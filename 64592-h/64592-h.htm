<h2 class="front">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">I</span><span class="afterlargecap">f</span>
a handy-book of electricity like this had fallen into
the hands of Thomas A. Edison when he was a newsboy
on the Grand Trunk Railway, or when he was a telegraph
operator, he would have devoured it with the utmost eagerness.
To be sure, at that time, in the early sixties, all that
we knew of electricity and its applications could have been
told in a very brief compass. It was an almost unknown
field, and the crude form of the telegraph then in use
represented its most important application. There were
no electric lights; there was no telephone or phonograph;
there were no electric motors. Telegraphing, itself, was a
slow and difficult process. All the conditions were as far
removed as possible from the broad field of applied electricity
indicated in this book.</p>

<p>But this does not mean that we have now accomplished
all that there is to be done. On the contrary, the next half-century
will be full of wonderful advances. This makes it
more than ever essential that we should become acquainted
with the principles and present conditions of a science which
is being applied more and more closely to the work of every-day
life. It is necessary to know this from the inside,
not simply from general descriptions. Theory is all very
well, but there is nothing like mastering principles, and
then applying them and working out results for one’s self.<span class="pagenum" id="Pagexii">[xii]</span>
Any active and intelligent boy with an inquiring mind
will find a new world opened to him in the satisfaction of
making electrical devices for himself according to the suggestions
given in this book. This will show him the reasons
for things in concrete form, will familiarize him with principles,
and will develop his mechanical ingenuity. He may
be laying the foundation for inventions of his own or for
professional success in some of the many fields which electricity
now offers. Work of this kind brings out what is in
one, and there is no satisfaction greater than that of winning
success by one’s own efforts.</p>

<p>The boy who makes a push-button for his own home, or
builds his own telephone line or wireless telegraph plant, or
by his own ingenuity makes electricity run his mother’s
sewing-machine and do other home work, has learned applications
of theory which he will never forget. The new
world which he will enter is a modern fairyland of science,
for in the use of electricity he has added to himself the
control of a powerful genie, a willing and most useful servant,
who will do his errands or provide new playthings,
who will give him manual training and a vast increase
in general knowledge. The contents of this book, ranging
from the preparation of simple cells to the making of
dynamos and motors, and the delightful possibilities of
electro-plating, shows the richness of the field which is made
accessible by Mr. Adams’ practical explanations, his carefully
tested working plans, and his numerous and admirable
drawings&mdash;all of which have been made for this book.</p>

<p>It is in keeping with the practical character of the <i>Electricity
Book</i> that pains are taken throughout to show the<span class="pagenum" id="Pagexiii">[xiii]</span>
simplest and most inexpensive way of choosing materials
and securing results. The actual working out of these directions
can be done at very small expense. Furthermore,
there need be no concern whatever as to possible danger if
the book is read with reasonable intelligence. Mr. Adams
has taken pains to place danger-signals wherever special
precautions are advisable, and, as a father of boys who are
constantly working with electricity in his laboratory, he may
be relied upon as a safe and sure counsellor and guide.</p>

<p>While this book shows boys what they can do themselves,
its scope has been enlarged by Mr. Baker’s <a href="#Page334">chapter</a> explaining
briefly the working of electricity all about us, in light
and heat, in the trolley-car, and other daily applications.
In addition, Mr. Adams has prepared a Dictionary of Electrical
Terms, and these brief definitions will be found peculiarly
helpful in the first reading of the book. It is believed
that there is no book in this particular field comparable to
Harper’s <i>Electricity Book</i> in its comprehensiveness, practical
character, and the number and usefulness of its illustrations.
It follows the successful <i>Out-door Book for
Boys</i> in Harper’s series of <i>Practical Books for Boys</i>, and
it will be followed by <i>How to Understand Electrical Work</i>,
a book, not of instructions in making electrical apparatus,
but of explanations of the commercial uses of electricity all
about us.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">SOME GENERAL EXPLANATIONS</span></h3>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">W</span><span class="afterlargecap">e</span>
are living in the age of electricity, just as our fathers
lived in the age of steam. Electricity is the world-power,
the most powerful and terrible of nature’s hidden
forces. Yet, when man has learned how to harness its fiery
energies, electricity becomes the most docile and useful
of his servants. Unquestionably, electricity is to-day the
most fascinating and the most profitable field for the investigator
and the inventor. The best brains of the country
are at work upon its problems. New discoveries are constantly
being recorded, and no labor is thought too great if
it but add its mite to the sum total of our knowledge. And
yet, ridiculous as the statement may seem, we do not know
what electricity is. We only know certain of its manifestations&mdash;what
it can do. All we can say is that it does our
bidding; it propels our trains, lights our houses and streets,
warms us, cooks for us, and performs a thousand and one
other tasks at the turn of a button or at the thrust of a
switch. But <i>what</i> it is, we do not know. Electricity has<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
no weight, no bulk, no color. No one has seen it; it cannot
be classified, nor analyzed, nor resolved into its ultimate
elements by any known process of science. We must content
ourselves with describing it as one manifestation of the
energy which fills the universe and appears in a variety of
forms&mdash;such as heat, light, magnetism, chemical affinity, and
mechanical motion. In all probability it is one of those
phenomena of nature that are destined to remain forever
secret. Thus it stands in line with gravitation, magnetism,
the active principle of radium, and the perpetual motion of
the solar system.</p>

<p>Electricity was known to the early Greeks; indeed, it
derives its name from the Greek word for amber (electron).
For many centuries amber was credited with certain special
or magical powers. When it was rubbed with a flannel
cloth, “the hidden spirit” came out and laid hold of small
detached objects, such as bits of paper, thread, chips, or
pith-balls. No one could explain this phenomenon. It
was looked upon with superstitious awe and the amber itself
was regarded as possessing the special attributes of divinity.
But as time went on, it was discovered that in various other
substances this mysterious attractive power could be excited,
at will, through the agency of friction. Rubbing a
piece of glass rod with silk or leather generated an “electricity”
identical with that of the amber; or the same result
could be obtained by exciting hard rubber with catskin.
The conclusion followed that electricity was not a property
of the special materials employed to generate it, but that
it came from without, from that great reservoir of energy,
the atmosphere. Then came Franklin with his experiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>
of the kite, and the invention of the Leyden-jar and the
chemical production of the electric fluid by means of
batteries. It was shown that the properties of the new
and strange force were the same, whether it was produced
by the static (frictional) process or by the galvanic
(chemical) method. Electrical science as a science, had
begun.</p>

<p>And yet, for many years, electricity was hardly more than
a scientific toy. It was not supposed to possess any practical
usefulness. The entertaining experiments with the
static machine and the Leyden-jar (<a href="#Page294">chapter xiii.</a>) were confined
to the laboratory and the lecture hall. Electricity
was an amusing display of unknown energy, but no one ever
dreamed that it could ever be made to serve the practical
ends of life. It was not until about 1850 that electrical
science became anything more than a name. The galvanic
and voltaic batteries (<a href="#Page12">chapter ii.</a>) opened the way for “current”
electricity, which flowed continuously, instead of
jumping and disappearing like the spark from a Leyden-jar.
When the continuous current became an established fact,
the telegraph and telephone headed the line of a long series
of developments. Finally, the generation of electricity in
greater volume, and cheaply, made possible the application
of its power for heating, light, traction, and the other forms
of activity in which it now does so large a share of the
world’s work.</p>

<p>How electricity works is a question often asked, but not
easily answered. There are certain so-called laws, but we
shall best arrive at a conclusion by simply stating a few
of the facts that have been established through the observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
and investigation of scientists and electrical engineers.<a id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Explanations of any technical names or phrases used in the text will
be found in the simple <a href="#Page359">dictionary of electrical terms</a> which appears as an
appendix.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>For example, electricity is always alert, ready to move,
and continually on the lookout for a chance to obtain its
freedom. It will never go the longest way round if there is
a short cut; and it will heat, light, or fuse anything in its
path that is too weak to carry or resist it. For this reason,
it must be generated in small volume&mdash;that is, just sufficient
to do the work required of it. If produced in larger volume,
it must be held in check by resistance, and only so much
allowed to escape as may be needed for the specified work.</p>

<p>Again, when electricity is generated this must be done in
one of two ways&mdash;by friction or chemically. But in both
processes there must be air surrounding the generators, and
the fluid must be of a nature through which oxygen and
hydrogen can circulate freely. Water fluids are suitable for
this purpose, but oils cannot be used, as they contain hydro-carbon
in large quantities and are non-conductors.</p>

<p>Batteries are chemical generators, dynamos are magneto-electric,
and static machines are frictional. Now the theory
is that electricity is drawn from the ether and, in its normal
state, is quiet. If it be disturbed and collected by
mechanical or chemical means, it is always on the alert to
escape and again take its place in the atmosphere. As its
volume is increased, so its energy to get away is multiplied,
and this energy may be transformed, at will, into power,
heat, or light. To express the idea in the simplest language,<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
it wants to go home, and in its effort to do so it expresses itself
in the form of stored-up power, precisely like water behind
a dam. It is for man’s cunning brain to devise all sorts of
tasks that this power must perform before it can gain its
release. It can’t go home until its work is done.</p>

<p>Nearly every boy has experimented, at one time or another,
with electricity and electrical apparatus, and whether
it was with some of the simple frictional or galvanic toys, or
with the more complicated induction-coils and motors, he has
undoubtedly found it a most interesting amusement and an
ever new and widening field for study. Then again, many
boys would like to know something about simple electrical
apparatus and how to make and use it. But his school-books
relating to the general subject of electricity are
hardly definite enough to serve as a practical manual. And
yet there are many things in the way of electrical machinery
and equipment that a boy can easily construct and use. In
this book it is my purpose to show him just what can be done
with the aid of the tools that are usually in his possession.
While some things may have to be purchased from an electrical
supply-house or other sources, there is still much
material to be found about the house that may be put to
good use by the amateur electrician.</p>

<p>It is not possible or desirable to describe every variety of
electrical equipment. We must confine ourselves to apparatus
which can be readily understood and operated. The
“practical” idea is the one to be borne in mind. This book
shows a boy how to use his brains and the simple tools and
material that may be at his command. Care and thought
in the construction of the apparatus are the important<span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span>
qualifications for success. The instructions are given in the
clearest possible language; the diagrams and drawings are
intelligible to any one who will take the trouble to study
them. If your finished apparatus does not work properly,
read the description again and see if you have not made some
error. A misplaced or broken wire, a wrong connection, or
a short circuit will mean all the difference between success
and failure.</p>

<p>Save in one short chapter, static or frictional electricity
(see <a href="#Page359">Appendix</a>) is not considered; for outside of laboratory
experimenting and electro-medical apparatus, frictional
electricity is but a toy&mdash;interesting and useful when generated
in small volume, but very dangerous and difficult of
control when in great volume. For example, the bolt of
lightning is but the many times multiplied spark stored in
the Leyden-jar by the static machine. For all practical
purposes, galvanic electricity, in its various phases of direct
and alternating current, meets the requirements of man.
With the improved apparatus and the rapid advancement
along the line of invention, electricity is as easily controlled
to-day as steam&mdash;in fact, its economical use is even more
fully under control and its adaptability more practical.</p>

<p>In the following pages there are probably illustrations
and descriptions of many things that will seem strange to
the boy who has not heard of them; but if a book were
written each year on the subject of electricity, every new
one would include principles and facts not known before.
The field of electrical research is so broad and so many are
working in it that new discoveries are being made continually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span></p>

<p>To those familiar with the application of electricity, it is
clearly evident that, as yet, we are only beginning to deal
with this unknown force. For generations to come, developments
will take place and invention follow invention until
electricity assumes its rightful place as the motive force of
the world. To the boy interested in this subject a wide
field is open, and the youth of to-day, who are taking up
this study, are destined to become the successful electrical
engineers and inventors of the future. There is no better
education for any boy, in the application and principles of
electricity, than to begin at the very bottom of the ladder
and climb up, constructing and studying as he progresses.
When he attempts to design more technical and difficult
apparatus the lessons learned in a practical way will be of
inestimable value, greater by far than any theoretical principles
deduced from books; he knows his subject from the
ground up; he understands his machine because he has constructed
it with his own hands.</p>

<p>As I have said already, the necessary tools are few in number
and not expensive. They may include a hammer, a
plane, awls, pliers, wire-cutters, and tin-shears. The raw
material is also cheap&mdash;lead, tin, wire, wood, and simple
chemicals. The laboratory may be a corner in the attic, or
even in a boy’s bedroom, so far as the finer work is concerned,
while the hammering and sawing may be done in
the cellar. The other best plan, of course, is to get the use
of a spare room which may be fitted with shelves, drawers,
and appliances for serious work. To enthusiastic beginners,
as well as to those who have had some experience in electricity,
a needed warning may be given in three words:<span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span>
“Take no chances.” Electricity, the subtle, stealthy, and
ever-alert force, will often deal a blow when least expected.
For that reason, a boy should never meddle with a high-tension
current or with the mains from dynamos. The
current in the house, used for lighting, cooking, or heating
purposes, is always an attractive point for the young electrician,
but the wires should never be touched in any way.
Too many accidents have happened, and the conductors,
lamp-sockets, and plugs should be carefully avoided.</p>

<p>The boy should keep strictly to his batteries, or small
dynamos run by water-power from a faucet; in no case
should the wire from power-houses be tampered with. One
little knows what a current it may be carrying and what
a death-dealing force it possesses. Always bear in mind
that a naked wire falling from a trolley equipment carries
enough force to kill anything it strikes.</p>

<p>Special attention is called to the dictionary of electrical
terms given in the <a href="#Page359">Appendix</a>. The young student should
never pass over a word or a term that he does not thoroughly
understand. Always look it up at once and <i>every
time</i> it occurs, until you are sure that its meaning is fixed
in your mind. This is an education in itself, at least so far
as the theoretical knowledge of our subject is concerned.</p>

<p>As a final word, I should like every boy interested in
electricity to hear what Thomas A. Edison once said to me
when I was a boy working in his laboratories. I often recall
it when things do not go just right at first.</p>

<p>I asked the great inventor one day if invention was not
made up largely of inspiration. He looked at me quizzically
for a moment, and then replied: “My boy, I have little use<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
for a man who works on inspiration. Invention is two parts
inspiration and ninety-eight per cent. perspiration.”</p>

<p>You will never get what you are after unless you work
hard for it. You must stick to it until you produce results.
If the history of the world’s most valuable inventions could
be fully known, the fact would be clearly established that
the vital spark of inspiration is but the starting-point.
Then follow the days, weeks, and sometimes years of
industrious toil, failures, and disappointments, until finally
the desired end is attained. One must work for success;
there is no other means of winning it.</p>

<p>As the <a href="#Pagevii">table of contents</a> shows, <a href="#Page3">Part I.</a> of this book
explains principles and the simpler forms of electrical appliances.
From this we advance to <a href="#Page123">Part II.</a>, which deals
with more complex forms of electrical work, most of which,
however, are within the reach of intelligent boys who have
followed the chapters carefully from the first. In a <a href="#Page334">final
chapter</a> we have simple explanations of the great commercial
uses of electricity, which we see all about us, although
very few of us have a clear idea as to their operation.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">CELLS AND BATTERIES</span></h3>

<h4>Simple Cells</h4>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">I</span><span class="afterlargecap">n</span>
order to generate electricity it is necessary to employ
cells, batteries, or dynamos. Since the construction and
operation of a dynamo is somewhat intricate, it will be better
to start with the simpler methods of electric generation,
and so work up to the more complicated forms. For small
apparatus, such as electric bells and light magnets and
motors, the zinc-carbon-sal-ammoniac cell will answer very
well; but for larger machinery, where more current is required,
the bluestone and the bi-chromate batteries will
be found necessary.</p>

<p class="caption">SIMPLE BATTERY ELEMENTS</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A simple and inexpensive cell may be made from electric-light
carbons, with the copper coating removed, and pencils
of zinc, such as are used for electric-bell batteries and which
can be purchased for five cents each. Copper wire is to be
bound around the top of each pencil of carbon and zinc,
and firmly fastened with the pliers, so that it will not pull
off or become detached. It will be well to cut a groove
with a file around the top of both the carbon and zinc, into
which the wire will fit. The elements should then be<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13-<br />14]<a id="Page14"></a></span>
clamped between two pieces of wood and held with screws,
as shown in <a href="#FigII1">Fig. 1</a>. A more efficient carbon pole is made by
strapping six or more short carbon pencils around one long
one, as shown in <a href="#FigII3">Fig. 3</a>. The short pieces of electric-light
carbons are bound to the longest carbon with heavy elastic
bands, or cotton string dipped in paraffine or wax, to make
the cotton impervious to water and the sal-ammoniac
solution.</p>

<p>Another arrangement of elements is shown in <a href="#FigII2">Fig. 2</a>,
where a zinc rod is suspended between two carbons, the
carbons being connected by a wire that must not touch the
zinc.</p>

<p>A fruit-jar, or a wide-necked pickle-bottle, may be employed
for a cell, but before the solution is poured in, the
upper edge of the glass should be coated with paraffine.
This should be melted and applied with a brush, or the edge
of the glass dipped in the paraffine.</p>

<p>The solution is made by dissolving four ounces of sal-ammoniac
in a pint of water, and the jar should be filled
three-fourths full. In this solution the carbons and zinc
may be suspended, as shown in the illustration (<a href="#FigII4">Fig. 4</a>) of
the sal-ammoniac cell. The wood clamps keep the carbon
and zinc together, and the extending ends rest on the top
of the jar and hold the poles in suspension. Plates of zinc
and carbon may be clamped on either side of a square stick
and suspended in the sal-ammoniac solution, as shown in
<a href="#FigII5">Fig. 5</a>, taking care, however, that the screws used for clamping
do not touch each other.</p>

<p>If one cell is not sufficiently powerful, several of them
may be made and coupled up in series&mdash;that is, by carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
the wire from the zinc of one to the carbon of the next cell,
and so on to the end, taking care that the wire from the carbon
in the first cell and that from the zinc of the last cell
will be the ones in hand, as shown in <a href="#FigII6">Fig. 6</a>. This constitutes
a battery. Be sure and keep the ends of the wire
apart, to prevent galvanic action and to save the power of
the batteries.</p>

<p>This battery is an excellent one for bells and small experimental
work, and when inactive the zincs are not eaten
away (as they would be if suspended in a bi-chromate
solution), for corrosion takes place only as the electricity
is required, or when the circuit is closed. A series of batteries
of this description will last about twelve months, if
used for a bell, and at the end of that time will only require
a new zinc and fresh solution.</p>

<p>The cell in which the plates shown in <a href="#FigII5">Fig. 5</a> are used
may contain a bi-chromate solution; and for experimental
work, where electricity is required for a short time
only, this will produce a stronger current. But remember
that the solution eats the zinc rapidly, and the plates
must be removed as soon as you have finished using
them.</p>

<p>The bi-chromate solution is made by slowly pouring four
ounces of commercial sulphuric acid into a quart of cold
water. This should be done in an earthen jar, since the
heat generated by adding acid to water is enough to crack
a glass bottle. Never pour the water into the acid. When
the solution is about cold, add four ounces of bi-chromate of
potash, and shake or mix it occasionally until dissolved;
then place it in a bottle and label it:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span></p>

<p class="center highline2 blankbefore1 blankafter1"><span class="fsize80">BI-CHROMATE BATTERY FLUID</span><br />
<span class="fsize110">POISON</span></p>

<p>Before the zincs are immersed in the bi-chromate solution
they should be well amalgamated to prevent the acid from
eating them too rapidly.</p>

<p>The amalgamating is done by immersing the zincs in a
diluted solution of sulphuric acid for a few seconds, and
then rubbing mercury (quicksilver) on the surfaces. The
mercury will adhere to the chemically cleaned surfaces of
any metal except iron and steel, and so prevent the corroding
action of the acid. Do not get on too much mercury,
but only enough to give the zinc a thin coat, so that it will
present a silvery or shiny surface.</p>

<p>A two-fluid cell is made with an outer glass or porcelain
jar and an inner porous cup through which the current can
pass when the cup is wet. <a href="#FigII7">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<p>A porous cup is an unglazed earthen receptacle, similar
to a flower-pot, through which moisture will pass slowly.
The porous cup contains an amalgamated plate of zinc
immersed in a solution of diluted sulphuric acid&mdash;one ounce
to one pint of water. The outer cell contains a saturated
solution of sulphate of copper in which a cylindrical piece
of thin sheet-copper is held by a thin copper strap, bent over
the edge of the outer cell. A few lumps or crystals of the
copper sulphate, or bluestone, should be dropped to the
bottom of the jar to keep the copper solution saturated at
all times. When not in use, the zinc should be removed
from the inner cell and washed off; and if the battery is
not to be employed for several days, it would be well to<span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span>
pour the solutions back into bottles and wash the several
parts of the battery, so that it may be fresh and strong
when next required. When in action, the solutions in both
cups should be at the same level, and be careful never to
allow the solutions to get mixed or the copper solution to
touch the zinc. Coat the top of the porous cell with paraffine<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
to prevent crystallization, and also to keep it clean.
Take great care, in handling the acid solutions, to wear old
clothes, and do not let the liquids spatter, for they are
strong enough to eat holes in almost anything, and even to
char wood. The two-fluid cells are much stronger than the
one-solution cells, and connected up in series they will develop
considerable power.</p>

<p>For telegraph-sounders, large electric bells, and as accumulators
for charging storage-batteries, the gravity-cell
will give the most satisfactory results. The one shown in
<a href="#FigII8">Fig. 8</a> consists of a deep glass jar, three strips of thin copper
riveted together, and a zinc crow-foot that is caught on the
upper edge of the glass jar. These parts will have to be
purchased at a supply-house, together with a pound or two
of sulphate of copper (bluestone).</p>

<p>To set up the cell, place the copper at the bottom and
drop in enough of the crystals to generously cover the
bottom, but do not try to imbed the metallic copper in
the crystals; then fill the jar half full of clear water. In
another jar dissolve two ounces of sulphate of zinc in
enough water to complete the filling of the jar to within
two inches of the top; then hang the zinc crow-foot on the
edge of the jar so that it is immersed in the liquid and is
suspended about three inches above the top of the copper
strip. The wire that leads up from the copper should be
insulated with a water-proof coating and well covered with
paraffine. A number of these cells may be connected in
series to increase the power of the current, and for a working-battery
this will show a high efficiency. Note that at
first the solutions will mingle. To separate them, join the<span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span>
two wires and start the action; then, in a few hours, a dividing
line will be seen between the white, or clear, and the
blue solutions, and the action of the cell will be stronger.
After long-continued use it may be necessary to draw off
some of the clear zinc sulphate, or top solution, and replace
it with pure water. The action of the acids reduces the
metallic zinc to zinc sulphate and deposits metallic copper
on the thin copper strips, and in this process an electrical
current is generated.</p>

<h4>A Plunge-battery</h4>

<p>When two or more cells (in which sulphuric acid, bi-chromate
of potash, or other strong electropoions are employed)
are coupled in series, it would be well to arrange the
copper and zinc, or the zinc and carbon, poles on a board,
so that all of them may be lowered together into the solutions
contained in the several jars. A simple arrangement
of this kind is shown in <a href="#FigII9">Fig. 9</a>, where a rack is built for the
jars and at the top of the end boards a projecting piece of
wood, supported by a bracket, is made fast. A narrow piece
of board nearly the length of the jar-rack is fitted with the
battery-poles, as shown at <a href="#FigII9">Fig. 9</a> A. The carbon and zinc,
or copper and zinc, poles are attached to small blocks of
wood (as described for <a href="#FigII5">Fig. 5</a>), and this block in turn is
fastened to the under side of the board with brass screws.
The poles of the cells are to be connected (as explained in
<a href="#FigII6">Fig. 6</a>), and when the battery is in use the poles are immersed
in the solution contained in the jars. When the battery is
at rest the narrow board should be lifted up and placed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
the projecting arms of the rack, so that the liquid on the
poles may drain into the jars directly underneath. One or
more of these battery-racks may be constructed, but they
cannot be made to hold conveniently more than four or six
cells each; if more cells are required, those contained in each
rack must be coupled up in series.</p>

<div class="container m40" id="FigII9">

<div class="figcenter nomargin" id="FigII10">
<img src="images/illo020.jpg" alt="Batteries" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A simpler plunge-battery is shown in <a href="#FigII10">Fig. 10</a>. A cell-rack
is made of wood and given two or three coats of
shellac. The narrow board (to the under side of which the
battery-poles are attached, as explained in <a href="#FigII9">Fig. 9</a>) is hung
on chains or flexible wires, which in turn are made fast to
an iron shaft running the entire length of the cell-rack.
This shaft is of half-inch round iron, and is held in place,
at one end, by a pin and washer; while at the other the end
is filed with a square shoulder, and a handle and crank is
fitted to it, so that the shaft may be turned. A small hole,
made at the side of the crank when it is hanging down, will
receive a hard-wood peg, or a steel nail, and this will prevent
the crank from slipping when the board holding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span>
poles is raised. If a gear-wheel and tongue can be had to fit
on the shaft, it will then be possible to check the shaft
securely at any part of a turn of the crank. The battery-poles
are to be connected in series along the top of the
portable board, as explained for <a href="#FigII6">Fig. 6</a>. When two or more
of these plunge-batteries are used at one time, the wire from
the carbon of one is to be connected with the zinc pole of
the next, and so on. The wire from the zinc of the first
battery, and the wire from the carbon of the last battery,
will be the ones available for use.</p>

<h4>A Storage-battery</h4>

<p>When more current is desired than the simple batteries
will give, a storage-battery should be employed as an accumulator.
This result can be secured by coupling primary
cells in series, so that they will be constantly generating
and feeding the battery. Storage-batteries are too heavy
to be shifted about, like single cells or small plunge-batteries;
they should be placed in a cellar, where the charging or
primary cells can be located close by, and, unless positively
necessary, the battery of cells and the accumulator should
not be moved.</p>

<p>With sufficiently large insulated wires (Nos. 12, 14, or 16
copper), the current may be carried to any part of the house
for use in various ways&mdash;such as running a light motor or
a fan, lighting a lamp-circuit, or fusing metals and chemicals
for experimental purposes. While the battery to be described
is not a light one in weight, nor as economical as the
improved new Edison storage-battery, it is a good and<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
constant one, and, if not overcharged or abused, will last
for several years.</p>

<p>The component parts of a storage-battery are lead in
metallic and chemical form, the electrolyte, or fluid, in
which the plates are immersed, and the water-tight and
chemical-proof cell or container. From a plumber, a supply-house,
or a lead-works, obtain a quantity of three-eighth
by one-quarter-inch strip-lead of the kind called chemical,
or desilverized; also a larger quantity of lead-tape, one-sixty-fourth
of an inch thick and three-eighths of an inch
wide. This last is also known as torpedo-lead, and is kept
by electrical supply-houses.</p>

<p>If the three-eighths by quarter-inch strip-lead cannot be
had, then purchase eight or ten pounds of heavy sheet-lead,
and, with a tin-shears, divide it into strips three-eighths of
an inch wide and twenty-nine inches long, taking care to
cut it of uniform width and with true edges. From hard-wood
three-eighths or half an inch thick, cut a block six
by seven inches and make four countersunk holes in it, so
that it may be screwed fast to a table or bench, as shown in
<a href="#FigII11">Fig. 11</a> A. Around this the lead strips should be shaped
and beaten at the corners to make the angles sharp.</p>

<p>From the three-eighths by quarter-inch, or sheet-lead
strips, make seven frames as shown in <a href="#FigII12">Fig. 12</a>. This is done
by binding a strip of the lead around the block, as shown
at <a href="#FigII11">Fig. 11</a> B. Where the ends come together insert a short
piece of lead, three-eighths or half-inch, as shown at <a href="#FigII12">Fig.
12</a> A, and solder it fast. A soldering-iron may be heated
with a Bunsen-burner gas-flame or in a charcoal fire. However,
if gas is available, it would be better to use the blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>
flame from a Bunsen burner and direct the hot blast directly
on the work with a blow-pipe, and so fuse the lead points
together. After a little practice with the blow-pipe it will
be used for many pieces of work in preference to the soldering-iron.
If the sheet-lead is used for the frames in place of
the three-eighths by quarter-inch strips, two or three strips
will have to be taken, so as to build up the band of the frame
to about a quarter of an inch in thickness. When soldered
together, or fused at the edges, these built-up frames will be
as rigid as the solid metal.</p>

<div class="container m40">

<a id="FigII12"></a>
<a id="FigII13"></a>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo023.jpg" alt="Leadwork" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Now cut a number of strips of the thin lead-tape six inches
and a half long, and others that will necessarily be somewhat
longer, for each frame is to be filled with straight and
crimped pieces, as shown in <a href="#FigII13">Fig. 13</a>. If there is a fluting-iron
in the house, the crimping may be done in the brass
gears at one end of the machine. Or two wheels may be
cut from hard-wood with a fret-saw, and made fast to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
block with screws, as shown in <a href="#FigII14">Fig. 14</a>. A handle, attached
to one wheel, will make it possible to turn the gears; and
they should be placed just far enough apart to allow the
tape to pass through without tearing or squeezing. Put a
washer between the wheel and the block to prevent friction.</p>

<p>When a frame is in the position shown in <a href="#FigII13">Fig. 13</a>, and
lying on a piece of slate or flat stone, you will first put in a
crimped piece of tape, as shown at <a href="#FigII13">Fig. 13</a> A, and under this
arrange a straight piece (<a href="#FigII13">Fig. 13</a> B); then, with the blow-pipe
and flame, fuse fast to the frame and catch the flutes
of the crimped piece to the straight one every inch or two.
Add alternate crimped and straight strips until the frame
is filled and presents the appearance of <a href="#FigII13">Fig. 13</a>. When the
seven frames are ready, lay three of them aside for the
positives and four for the negatives. Note that the positives
are red and the negatives a dark yellow when they are
filled with the active material.</p>

<p>There are several methods of depositing the active material
in the mesh or net-work of the plates, but some of them
are too technical, others too complicated, and still others
require charging machinery. The following plan will be
the simplest and easiest for the amateur:</p>

<p>At a paint-store, or from a wholesale druggist, obtain
several pounds of oxide of lead (red-lead) and a similar
quantity of litharge (yellow-lead). In an earthen vessel,
or large jar, make a solution composed of water, twenty
ounces, and commercial sulphuric acid, two ounces. This
is the mixture commonly known as “one to ten.” Place
some red-lead (dry) in an old saucepan or soup-plate, and
add a little of the acid solution: then, with an old table-knife<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
or small trowel, mix the lead into a stiff paste, like
soft putty. Do not get it too thin or it will run; nor too
thick, as then it will not properly adhere to the lead-mesh
of the frames. With the frame lying on its side, plaster
in the red composition between the flutes and fill up the
frame solid with it. Treat all three of the positive frames
in the same manner, taking care that the exposed surfaces
of the composition-filling is smooth and flush with the edges
of the lead frame and mesh. Do not disturb these plates
for a while, but let them remain in position, so as to set and
partially dry. Add acid solution to the yellow-lead in a
similar manner, and fill the four negative plates. When
partially dry, the plates will be ready to combine in a pile.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>At a supply-house obtain some sheets of cellulous fibre,
three-sixteenths of an inch thick, or some asbestos cloth.
If neither can be had, then soak some pieces of ordinary
brown card-board in a solution of silicate of soda and let
them dry. Lay a negative (yellow) plate on the table with
the lug at the left (<a href="#FigII13">Fig. 13</a> C). On this place a square of
the fibre, asbestos, or card-board; and on top of it lay a
positive (red) plate with the lug at the right side. Continue
in this manner until the seven plates are stacked, the four
negative lugs being at the left and the three positives at
the right. Tie the plates securely together with cotton
string bound about them in both directions; then stand the
pile up so that the lugs are at the top, as shown at <a href="#FigII15">Fig. 15</a>,
with every alternate lug in an opposite direction. Obtain
two lead bars three-eighths of an inch square, or cut strips
from the sheet-lead and solder them together, turning the
ends as shown at <a href="#FigII13">Fig. 13</a> D. Drop one of these bars into<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
the lugs of the positive plates, as shown in <a href="#FigII15">Fig. 15</a> H, and
solder it fast at the three unions. Repeat this with the
other bar in the lugs of the negative plates, and the pile will
then be ready for immersion in the electrolyte. To both
ends of each plate-bar solder binding-posts, so that the conductor-wires
can be attached at one end and the feed-wires
at the other. If a hard rubber or glass cell can be had for
the battery so much the better; if not, a stout box may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
made from pine, white-wood, or cypress, and thoroughly
coated with asphaltum varnish or asphaltick. At an electrical
supply-house you can purchase some “P and B”
compound, which is acid and water proof. This is excellent
for the inside coating as well as for the outside of the box.</p>

<p>The box should be made of wood not less than three-quarters
of an inch thick, and the sides, ends, and bottom
should be in one piece, free from knots, sappy places, or
cracks. Brass screws should be used to hold the boards
together, and before the joints are made the butt-ends of
wood and the sides, against which they impinge, must be
thoroughly coated with the asphaltum or compound. Put
together the four sides first and then make the bottom fast,
placing the screws two inches apart and countersinking the
wood, so that the screw-heads will lie flush, as shown in <a href="#FigII16">Fig.
16</a>. The box should be large enough to allow about one
inch of space all around the pile, and deep enough for the
solution to cover the plates and two inches of space above it
to the top edge of the cell. The complete storage-battery
will then appear as shown in <a href="#FigII17">Fig. 17</a>.</p>

<p>The electrolyte is composed of sulphuric acid and water
in the proportion of one ounce of acid to four of water,
making a five-part solution. This should be mixed in an
earthen or glass jar, and the acid poured slowly into the
water, the latter being stirred while the acid is added.
When the solution cools (for adding acid to water creates
heat), add about two ounces of bicarbonate of soda, and
mix the solution thoroughly.</p>

<p>When the pile is in place within the box (having first
removed the string which bound the plates together) pour<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
the electrolyte slowly into the cell, taking care that none of
it spatters, for it will eat clothing or anything else that it
touches. Before placing the pile, or electrolyte, in the box,
it should be thoroughly tested for leaks by allowing water
to stand in it for several days. Indeed, you should be very
generous with the asphaltum, or compound, when coating
the angles and points inside the box; for if the acid solution
gets at the screws it will corrode them and the box will soon
leak and fall apart. As a precaution against the acid working
over the top of the box, the upper edge, for an inch or
two, should be coated with paraffine over the asphaltum or
acid-proof coating.</p>

<p>A cell constructed in this way should accumulate about
two volts and one hundred ampere-hours, and will run a
one-sixteenth horse-power motor. The expense of making
these plates is about twenty-five cents each, and, including
the cell and coating materials, each storage-battery will cost
approximately two dollars. The lasting qualities of the
battery depend on the use or abuse it is put to; but with
ordinary care it should last from three to five years.</p>

<p>When the battery ceases to accumulate properly the pile
should be removed, and, after washing it thoroughly, the
bars should be cut away and new positive plates made and
installed. The positive plates are the ones that deteriorate
and need replacing; the negatives are almost everlasting,
and with proper usage will live for fifteen or twenty years.</p>

<p>Directly the electrolyte is in the cell, connect the poles of
your primary cells so as to begin the accumulation of current.
Never exhaust the charge of electricity from your
storage-cell, and never leave it uncharged when the electrolyte<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
is in, or the plates will be ruined. A battery consisting
of from five to twenty bluestone cells will be the best with
which to charge this accumulator; and if more than one cell
is desired, any number of them can be made and coupled
up in series. Take care, when connecting the wires from
the primary cells, to see that the positive wire is connected
with the positive plates and the negative with the lead bar
joining the yellow plates. If by accident you should make
a misconnection, bubbles will rise from the electrolyte. This
is not right, so reverse the wires and the accumulation of
current will then take place without agitation in the cell.</p>

<h4>Dry-cells and Batteries</h4>

<div class="figright m20" id="FigII18">
<img src="images/illo030.jpg" alt="Battery" />
</div>

<p>Dry-cells are extensively used nowadays, since their cleanliness,
high efficiency, and low internal resistance make them
preferable to the Leclanché and other open-circuit batteries
for bells, annunciators, and other light work. In the
dry-cell, the electrolyte, instead of being a liquid, is a gelatinous
or semi-solid mass, which will not run nor slop over.
When the capping of pitch or tar is in place, the cell may be
placed in any position, with full assurance that the electrolyte
will not become displaced nor run out. Dry-cells may
be made of almost any size for convenience of handling, but
those commonly used vary from one to four inches in diameter,
and from four to fifteen inches high. For bells and
general electric work, a cell two inches and a half in diameter
and seven inches high will be found a convenient size to
make and handle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span></p>

<p>The component parts of a dry-cell are the cell itself (which
is made of zinc and acts as the positive pole), the carbon, the
electrolyte or active excitant element, and the pitch or tar
cap to hold the electrolyte and carbon in place.</p>

<p>From a tinsmith obtain some pieces of sheet zinc, and roll
them into cylindrical form as shown in <a href="#FigII18">Fig. 18</a> A. The
sheets should measure seven by eight inches, and when
formed the edges are to be lapped and soldered.</p>

<p>From a smaller piece of
zinc cut round bottoms, fit
them in the cylinders and
solder securely in place,
taking care to close up
all seams or joints to prevent
the escape of the
electrolyte.</p>

<p>From a supply-house obtain
battery-carbons, one
inch and a half wide by
half or three-eighths of
an inch thick and eight
inches long. These should be provided with a thumb-screw
or small bolt and nut at the top so as to make wire connections
with the carbon. A strip of zinc should be soldered
to the outside upper edge of the zinc cup to which wire
attachments may be made with thumb-screws or small bolts
and nuts. When the parts are ready to assemble, make a
wooden mould or form a trifle larger than the carbon. This
is intended to act as a temporary plunger, and is inserted,
at first, in place of the carbon plate. This wooden plunger<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
should be smooth, and given a coat of shellac to prevent it
from absorbing any moisture.</p>

<p>Insert the plunger in the zinc cup and support it so that it
will be at least half an inch above the bottom and centred
at the middle of the cup. The electrolyte is then placed in
the cup, and, when it has set a little, the wooden plunger
is removed and the carbon inserted in its place.</p>

<p>The electrolyte is composed as follows:</p>

<table class="dontwrap fsize80" summary="Electrolyte">

<tr>
<td class="left padr3">Ammonium chloride</td>
<td class="left padl3">1 part</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr3">Zinc chloride</td>
<td class="left padl3">1 part</td>

<tr>
<td class="left padr3">Plaster of Paris</td>
<td class="left padl3">3 parts</td>

<tr>
<td class="left padr3">Flour</td>
<td class="left padl3">¾ part</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr3">Water</td>
<td class="left padl3">2 parts</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Mix these together and place the compound within the zinc
cups, so that the mass settles down and packs closely about
the plunger. The space left unfilled about the carbon
should be filled with a mixture composed as follows:</p>

<table class="dontwrap fsize80" summary="Electrolyte">

<tr>
<td class="left padr3">Ammonium chloride</td>
<td class="left padl3">1 part</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr3">Zinc chloride</td>
<td class="left padl3">1 part</td>
</tr>

<td class="left padr3">Manganese binoxide</td>
<td class="left padl3">1 part</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr3">Granulated carbon</td>
<td class="left padl3">1 part</td>

<td class="left padr3">Flour</td>
<td class="left padl3">1 part</td>

<tr>
<td class="left padr3">Plaster of Paris</td>
<td class="left padl3">3 parts</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr3">Water</td>
<td class="left padl3">2 parts</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>These proportions may be measured in a tin cup, a table-spoon,
or any other small receptacle. Note that the measurement
by parts is always by bulk and not by weight.</p>

<p>Do not fill the zinc cup to the top, but leave an inch of
space, so that half an inch of sealing material may be added.
See that the inside top edge of the zinc cup is clean; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
melt some tar or pitch and pour it over the top of the electrolyte,
so that it binds the zinc cup and carbon into a solid
form. Drive an awl down through the capping material
when it is nearly dry, and leave the holes open for the
escapement of gases.</p>

<p>Give the outer surface of the zinc cells a coat of asphaltum
varnish, and wrap several thicknesses of heavy paper about
them to prevent contact and short-circuiting. Protect the
bottoms in a similar manner, and as a result you will have
a cell that will appear as shown in <a href="#FigII18">Fig. 18</a> B. A battery
of cells powerful enough for any light work can be made
by connecting the cells in series, each having an electro-motive
force of one and a half volts, with an internal resistance
of less than one-third of an ohm.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">PUSH-BUTTONS AND SWITCHES</span></h3>

<h4>Push-buttons</h4>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">P</span><span class="afterlargecap">ush-buttons</span>
and switches are a necessity in every
home where electric bells, lights, or fans are used, for
with them connections are made or broken. The telegraph-key
and the commutators on a motor and dynamo are only
improved forms of the push-button, and this simple little
device is really an indispensable part of any electrical equipment.</p>

<p>The simplest form of push-button is a bent piece of tin or
thin sheet-metal screwed fast to a small block of wood, as
shown in <a href="#FigIII1">Fig. 1</a>. Under the screw-head one end of a wire
is caught, and the other wire end is secured by a washer and
a screw driven into the block directly under the projecting
end of the strip of metal. By pressing a finger on the tin
it is brought into contact with the screw-head under it, and
the circuit is closed; on releasing it, the tin flies up and the
circuit is opened again.</p>

<p>An enclosed push-button is shown in <a href="#FigIII2">Fig. 2</a>. It is made
of the cover or body of a wooden box, a spool-end, and several
other small parts. A round piece of thin wood is cut
to fit inside the box and so form the base for the button.<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
On this the spring strip is attached with screws, and the
wire ends are made fast, as shown in <a href="#FigIII3">Fig. 3</a>. The wires are
carried through the bottom of the base and along grooves to
the edge, and thence to their final destination. The end of
a spool is cut off and glued to the top of the box, as shown
in <a href="#FigIII2">Fig. 2</a>, and a hole is made in the box to correspond in size
with that in the spool. Through this aperture the button
(cut from a wooden dowel or shaped out with a knife) passes,
so that the end projects about a quarter of an inch beyond
the spool. To prevent the button from falling out, a small
steel nail should be driven across the inner end, or a washer
may be tacked to the end of the stick, as shown in <a href="#FigIII4">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The button is mounted by screwing the base fast to the
door or window casing, it being understood that the wires
have been first arranged in place. The button is then set<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
in the hole and the cap is placed over the base, covering it
completely. By means of small screws, passed through the
rim of the box and into the edge of the base, the cap is held
in place. A coat of paint or varnish will finish the wood-work
nicely, and this home-made button should then answer
every requirement.</p>

<h4 id="Ref005">Switches and Cut-outs</h4>

<p>In electrical equipment and experimental work, switches
and cut-outs will be found necessary, particularly so for
telegraph and telephone lines. Care should be taken to
construct them in a strong and durable fashion, for they
will probably be subjected to considerable wear and tear.</p>

<p>A simple switch (<a href="#FigIII5">Fig. 5</a>) is made from a base-block of
wood three inches long, two wide, and half an inch in thickness,
together with some small metal parts. It has but one
contact-point, and that is the brass-headed tack (T in <a href="#FigIII5">Fig. 5</a>)
driven through the binding-post, the latter being a small
plate of brass, copper, or even tin screwed to the base-block.
The end of a wire is caught under the screw-head before it
is driven down. A similar binding-post is arranged at the
lower side of the block, and the movable arm is attached to
it with a screw. Between the arm and the post-plate there
should be a small copper washer, to make it work more
easily. The arm is cut from a thin piece of hard sheet brass
or copper (tin or zinc will also answer very well), and at the
loose end the half of a small spool is attached, with a brass
screw and washer, to serve as a handle. The end of the
screw that passes through a hole in the arm is riveted to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
under side to hold it securely in place. This arrangement
is shown in <a href="#FigIII6">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

<div class="container">

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo036.jpg" alt="Switches" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The under edges of the arm may be slightly bevelled with a
file, so that it will slip up easily on the oval head of the brass
tack. The drawing shows an open switch; when the circuit
is closed the arm rests on the tack-head. By means of small
screws this switch-board may be fastened to a table or to
any part of the wood-work in a house.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FigIII7">Fig. 7</a> a complex switch is shown. This is the principle
of the shunt-box switch, of the resistance-coil, and also of
the commutators of a motor. A motorman’s controller on
a trolley-car is a good example of the shunt, and, with it
and the resistance-coils, the car can be started, stopped, or
run at any speed, according to the current that is admitted
to the motor.</p>

<p>The complex switch is made in the same manner as described
for the single switch, except that any number of
binding-posts may be employed, arranged on a radial plan,
so that the end of the arm will rest on any tack-head at will.
Bells in various parts of the house may be rung by this<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
switch, or it may be coupled with a series of resistance-coils
to control any amount of current.</p>

<p>The simple cut-out (<a href="#FigIII8">Fig. 8</a>) is constructed in the same
manner as the simple switch, except that there are two
points of contact instead of one. This is the principle of
the telephone and telegraph instrument wiring, so that a
bell or sounder may be rung from a distance. The arm is
then thrown over and the bell cut out, allowing the “phone”
or key to be brought into use. In lifting the transmitter
from the hook on a telephone, a cut-out is operated and
the bell circuit is thrown out of action. It is in operation
again directly the transmitter is returned to the hook.
The switch cut-out (<a href="#FigIII9">Fig. 9</a>) is inactive when the arm is in
the position shown in the illustration; but when it is thrown
over (as shown by the dotted line) it connects the poles at
opposite ends of the board. It may be thrown over in both
directions, and is a useful switch for many purposes.</p>

<p>For strong currents the lever-switch, that rests on a brass
tack-head, will not be suitable, as the switch-bar must be
held firmly in place to make a perfect connection. Strong
currents throw weak switches open, causing an open or
broken circuit.</p>

<p>A single pole-switch, to carry a current up to one hundred
and twenty-five volts and twenty-five amperes, is shown in
<a href="#FigIII10">Fig. 10</a>. This consists of a base-block, a bar which is attached
to the vertical ears of a binding-post, and a clutch
that will hold the bar when it is pressed down between the
ears.</p>

<p>The base-block should be made from some non-conducting
material, such as soapstone, marble, or slate. If a piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
soapstone can be procured, that will be just the thing, since
it is easily worked into the proper shape and size. Soapstone
may be sawed and smoothed with a file; it is easily
bored into with a gimlet-bit, and it is one of the best non-conducting
substances. The base for this switch is six
inches long, two inches wide, and as thick as the soapstone
happens to be&mdash;say three-quarters of an inch. The top
edge may be bevelled for the sake of appearance or left
square.</p>

<p>Two pieces of heavy sheet copper or brass are to be cut
as shown at A in <a href="#FigIII11">Fig. 11</a>. The ears are half an inch wide,
and the total height of the strip is two inches and a half,
while the part with two holes in it side by side is one inch
and a quarter long, including the half-inch width of the
vertical strip. With round and flat-nosed pliers bend the
long ears into shape, so as to form a keeper for the bar which
is then to be riveted in place. Omit the holes at the ends
of the long ears in the other plate; then bend it into shape
to form a clutch that will hold the bar when it is pressed
down between the ears. These binding-posts should be
made fast to the base-block with brass machine-screws and
nuts, which will fit in countersunk holes in the bottom of
the soapstone. If hard-wood is used for the base, ordinary
brass wood-screws will answer very well.</p>

<p>The connection-bar is cut from metal the same thickness
as that employed for the binding-posts and clutches; it
should be shaped so as to appear as shown at B in <a href="#FigIII11">Fig. 11</a>.
A handle should be driven on the slim end, and where the
lower edge enters between the ears of the clutch, the corners
of the bar should be rounded with a file. Countersunk<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
screw-holes are bored in the base, so that it can be made
fast to the wood-work.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A double pole-switch is shown in <a href="#FigIII12">Fig. 12</a>, and in general
construction it is similar to the single pole-switch described
above. The binding posts and bars are cut and bent from
the patterns A and B in <a href="#FigIII11">Fig. 11</a>; but in this case the long,
slim ends of the bars are omitted. A short turn is made at
the handle end of each bar and a hard-wood block is placed
between the bar-ends and held in position with screws
driven through holes made in the bars and into the ends of
the block. A handle is made fast to the middle of the block<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
with a long and slim wood-screw; or a steel-wire nail may
be passed through the handle and block, a burr slipped over
the end opposite the head, and the small end riveted fast.
When the binding-posts (to which the ends of the bars are
attached) are screwed onto the base, be sure and see that
the bars are parallel and the same distance apart at both
ends. In like manner, when the cleat binding-posts are
made fast, see that they are directly in line with the bars,
so that the yoke will drop into the spaces between the ears
without having to be pulled to one side or the other. This
is a very useful switch for strong currents, and may be
placed close to a dynamo, so that the current in both wires
may be cut out at once.</p>

<h4>Table-jack Switches</h4>

<p>A table-jack switch is a most convenient piece of apparatus
where several lines of bells, alarms, or telephone circuits
are to be switched on and off.</p>

<p>The single table-jack switch, shown in <a href="#FigIII13">Fig. 13</a>, is made of
a hard-wood block three-quarters of an inch thick, five
inches wide, and seven inches long. It is to be smoothed
and varnished, or given several coats of shellac. At the
four corners small holes are made to receive slim screws,
and at one end of the block five short metal plates are
screwed fast, with the heads of the screws countersunk, so
that they will be flush with the top of the plates. These
small plates should be half an inch wide and one inch long,
and may be of brass, copper, or tin. But if they are of tin
the plates are made of a longer strip tacked to the board<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
and then bent over, as shown at A in <a href="#FigIII14">Fig. 14</a>. They will
therefore form short springs, the upper parts of which will
rest against the long spring-arms. From spring brass or
copper five arms are to be cut and shaped, as shown in
<a href="#FigIII13">Fig. 13</a>. Holes are made at one end of each, and others
again two inches from these, through which to pass screws.</p>

<p>Screw-eyes are passed through copper washers and the
end holes in the strips, and then screwed into the wood plate.
These will act as binding-posts, while the second line of
screws will hold the plates down to the base. The arms
should be bent, so that when the screws are driven down the
lower edge will press on the small plates under them.</p>

<p>The outlet wires are attached to the binding-posts at the
head of the block, and the plug (A in <a href="#FigIII13">Fig. 13</a>) is inserted
between the arm and plate at the foot, so that contact and
connection are made. This plug is a small plate of metal to
which the end of a flexible wire is made fast. It should be
of copper or brass, but for light work a strip of tin may be
bent over with the wire caught between the plates and a
copper tack passed through the sides and riveted, as shown
at B in <a href="#FigIII14">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

<p>A double jack-switch (<a href="#FigIII15">Fig. 15</a>) is made on the same general
plan as the single, but it has no binding-posts. A block of
the same size is used, and two rows of short plates are made
fast at each end. The arms are made with two screw-holes
near the middle, as shown in <a href="#FigIII15">Fig. 15</a>, and through these
holes screws are driven to hold the arms down to the base.
Several plugs are used for each end, so that the in and out
lines can be shifted, and from one to four lines used at a
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span></p>

<p>A convenient slip-switch for single or double line work
is shown in <a href="#FigIII16">Fig. 16</a>. This consists of a small wooden base,
on which a brass arm and handle are screwed fast and
connected with a binding-post (A in <a href="#FigIII16">Fig. 16</a>). A slip-plate
is made from a piece of sheet-brass and bent so as to form
a pocket into which the arm will fit. This pocket piece is
connected with the binding-post B. When the switch is
thrown out the circuit is broken, unless a contact-point, C,
is provided, from the under side of which a wire leads out
to a second circuit. When the switch is in place, as shown
in <a href="#FigIII16">Fig. 16</a>, the circuit is closed through A and B; but when
the arm is thrown out the circuit through A and B is broken
and that through A and C is closed.</p>

<h4 id="Ref004">Binding-posts and Connectors</h4>

<p>To make quick connections between wires and other
parts of electrical apparatus, binding-posts are the most
convenient device, since the turn of a screw binds or releases
a wire instantly. Binding-posts may be made in many
forms, but the simple ones that a boy will need can be made
from screw-eyes, burrs, stove-bolts, and nuts, together with
thin strips of metal and nails.</p>

<p>Five simple posts are shown in <a href="#FigIII17">Fig. 17</a>. A is made from
a screw and two burrs, B from a screw-eye and two burrs,
and C from a thin plate of metal and two screws, with oval
or round heads. This last, however is more of a connector
than a binding-post. The ends of the wires to be connected
should be caught under the screw-heads or between the
burrs before the screws are driven down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span></p>

<p>In D a simple arrangement of a stove-bolt and two nuts
is shown. The under bolt is screwed down tightly against
the wood, and under the head a wire is made fast, so that
another wire may be caught under the upper nut. If a
small thumb-nut can be had in place of the plain nut, it will
be easier to bind the upper wire. In <a href="#FigIII17">Fig. 17</a> E a thin
strip of metal may be folded over, and at the loose ends a
hole should be punched through which a screw-eye will
pass. The metal is held to a wood base with a screw, under
the head of which a wire is caught. The second wire end is
slipped between the metal plates, and a turn of the screw-eye
will bind and hold it securely.</p>

<div class="container m40">
<a id="FigIII17"></a>
<a id="FigIII18"></a>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo044.jpg" alt="Connectors" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Connectors are employed to unite the ends of wires
temporarily, and are made in many forms. A simple and
useful one is made from a piece of spiral spring fastened to
a block of wood by two staples, as shown at <a href="#FigIII18">Fig. 18</a> A.<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
The ends of the wires are pressed down into the coils of the
spring and are held with sufficient security for temporary
use. Another connector is made from a block of wood, a
strip of thin metal, and two screw-eyes (<a href="#FigIII18">Fig. 18</a> B). The
metal is bent around the ends of the block, and through
holes made in the ends of the strip screw-eyes are driven into
the block. When the ends of wires are slipped under the
metal, a turn of the eyes will hold them fast, as shown at
<a href="#FigIII18">Fig. 18</a> B.</p>

<p>A short bolt threaded at each end and provided with four
nuts will also act as a connector. The inner nuts are screwed
on tightly and the outer ones are loose, so that when
wires are placed between them they may be tightened with
the fingers, as shown at C in <a href="#FigIII18">Fig. 18</a>. These are a few simple
forms of connectors; the ingenious boy can devise many
others to suit his needs and ideas.</p>

<h4>Lightning-arresters and Fuse-blocks</h4>

<p>All lines of exposed wire that run from out-doors into
the house should be provided at both ends with lightning-arresters,
particularly if they are telephone or telegraph
lines, burglar alarms, or messenger call-boxes. In many
instances where unprotected telephone lines have been the
plaything of lightning, painful accidents have happened,
and it is only the part of prudence to provide against them.
It is better to have an arrester at both ends of a line, and
as the cost is insignificant it is hardly worth considering as
against its feature of safety.</p>

<p>Lightning-arresters may be constructed in many ways<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
and of different materials; the ones here shown and described
are easily made and efficient. The principle of all
arresters is simply a fuse which burns out whenever the wire
is carrying a greater amount of current than is required for
the proper working of the apparatus, thereby arresting the
current and protecting the instruments from destruction.
Induction-coils, relays, fine windings on armatures, or a
magnet helix are quickly destroyed if a too powerful current
is permitted to pass through them, and it is therefore
advisable to protect them. When a fuse burns out under a
trolley-car, or in the shunt-box of a motor-car or engine,
it is because a greater amount of current is trying to pass
in than the motor will safely stand. When a fuse “blows
out,” the apparatus or motor is put out of commission until
the fuse is replaced, but the delicate mechanism and the fine
wiring on the field-magnets or armatures are saved.</p>

<p>The simplest form of single pole-fuse is a fine piece of
lead wire held between two binding-posts, as shown at A in
<a href="#FigIII19">Fig. 19</a>. The lead wire may be of any length; but for small
instruments, where a moderate current is employed and
where there is a possibility of lightning travelling on the
wire, the fuse should be from two to three inches long.
For inside work, however, where it is to be used simply as
a safety, the wire may be shorter and finer.</p>

<p>To make the lightning-arrester shown in <a href="#FigIII19">Fig. 19</a>, cut out
a hard-wood block five inches long, an inch wide, and half
an inch thick. Give this several coats of shellac; then place
a piece of mica, or asbestos paper, over the top of the block,
and make it fast with thick shellac to act as a glue. From
small pieces of copper or brass cut two plates one-half by<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
one inch, and drill holes in them to take screws and screw-eyes.
Place copper burrs under the screw-eyes for connectors,
and drive two brass screws half-way down in the block
through the holes at the inner ends of the binding-post
plates. See that these screws fit snugly in the holes in the
plates so that contact is perfect. If the holes are too large
and the screws fit loosely, two copper burrs will have to be
used and the screws driven in, so that the heads bind the
burrs on the ends of the fuse-wire. From an electrician, or
supply-house, purchase a few inches of fine lead fuse-wire&mdash;say
Nos. 20, 22, or 24&mdash;and twist the ends of a length around
the screws, as shown in the drawing. Perfect contact should
be had between the lead wire and the screws; by way of
precaution, a bit of solder will dispel all doubt. Just touch
the point with a little soldering solution; then apply a
soldering-iron having a drop or two of solder on the end.</p>

<p>Perfect connection is absolutely necessary for telephone,
telegraph, or annunciator work, and where there is a lightning-arrester
and the line is not working well, the trouble
may often lie in the poor contact of lead and brass or copper,
or possibly in using wire that is too fine. Lead is a very
poor conductor, and a fine wire would act as a check. For
a test, first insert a piece of copper wire to see that the line
is working properly; then use lead wire of sufficient size to
carry the current as well as the copper did. The action of
metals and wire, as current retarders, will be explained in
the <a href="#Page125">chapter</a> on resistance and resistance-coils.</p>

<p>For general commercial use the base-blocks of all lightning-arresters
should be made of porcelain, slate, or some
of the composition non-conductors, such as moulded mica,<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
silex and shellac, or fibre. As these are not always available,
wood, with a covering of mica, will answer every purpose
and can be readily adapted for use.</p>

<p>The apparatus pictured in <a href="#FigIII19">Fig. 19</a> is known as a single-pole
lightning-arrester, and is the simplest form of this kind
of electrical paraphernalia. In <a href="#FigIII20">Fig. 20</a> a double-pole arrester
is shown. This is constructed in the same manner
as described for the single one. The block is five inches
long, two inches wide, and half or five-eighths of an inch
thick. A countersunk hole is made in the middle of all the
lightning-arrester blocks through which a screw can be
passed to hold the apparatus fast in any desired location.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FigIII21">Fig. 21</a> another form of fuse is shown. It is made
from a piece of mica three-quarters of an inch wide and four
inches long, two pieces of thin sheet-copper, and a piece of
lead fuse-wire. The copper is three-quarters of an inch
wide, and one piece of it is bent in the form of a <span class="symbol">V</span>, as shown
at A in <a href="#FigIII21">Fig. 21</a>. One end of the mica strip is dropped in the
<span class="symbol">V</span>, and with a pair of pliers the <span class="symbol">V</span> is closed up by pinching
it at the bottom. To further insure its staying in place, the
top and end, or open edges, should be soldered. Punch a
small hole through the copper ends, at the inside edge, slip
the ends of the fuse-wire in them, and touch the union with
a drop of solder to insure perfect contact. With shears and
file cut a <span class="symbol">U</span> from the side of one copper band and from the
end of the other; these will allow the copper ends to pass
under the heads of screws, thus avoiding the necessity of
removing the entire screw from the block in order to set the
fuse in place.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span></p>

<p>The block on which this fuse is held is shown in <a href="#FigIII22">Fig. 22</a>,
and is made in a similar manner to the one shown in <a href="#FigIII19">Fig. 19</a>,
except that the metal plates are a trifle longer and are
bent up, as shown in the drawing. Thus the mica fuse-plate
will be elevated above the block. If the brass or copper
used for the binding-post plates is too thin to stand the
pressure of the screws when the fuse ends are screwed fast,
put a few burrs on the screws below the plates; then the
pressure of the screws cannot bend down the extending ears
of the plates and make an imperfect contact.</p>

<p>Another form of fuse-block is shown in <a href="#FigIII23">Fig. 23</a>. The
same sort of a fuse is employed as shown in <a href="#FigIII21">Fig. 21</a>, but
without the <span class="symbol">U</span> cuts at the ends. The clutches are made by
binding brass or copper plates, as shown in the drawing;
they should then be screwed fast to a base-block five inches
long, one inch and a half wide, and five-eighths of an inch
thick. The opening between them should just admit the
copper ends of the fuse, and pressure should be used to force
the fuse in place so that the contact will be perfect.</p>

<p>Still another form of fuse is shown in <a href="#FigIII24">Fig. 24</a>. This last
may more properly be called a non-sparking fuse, for the
lead wire is encased in a glass tube, and when it fuses no
sparks fly and no small pieces of melted metal can get away
from the inside of the tube. The plug is made from a piece
of glass tube half an inch in diameter, two metal caps, and
a short piece of lead wire. The metal caps are of thin
sheet-copper, and are caught at the edges with solder. One
end of the lead fuse-wire is passed through a hole in the
end of a cap and soldered, as shown at A in <a href="#FigIII24">Fig. 24</a>. The
wire is then passed through the tube and the cap placed
over one end of it. This is repeated at the other end and<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
the wire soldered fast. As a result, you will have a glass
tube with metal caps held on the ends of the tube, by means
of the thin lead wire which runs through the middle of the
tube. The base-block to which this fuse-plug is attached
is of wood one inch and a half wide, five or six inches long,
and five-eighths of an inch thick. Two metal straps are
made and screwed fast to the block, and the circuit wires
are attached under the copper burrs and held down by the
screw-eyes.</p>

<p>To place or replace a fuse-plug, unscrew the eyes and raise
each strap slightly, so that the copper cap ends will pass
under them. A turn or two of the eyes will clamp the plug
in position and at the same time bind the circuit wires.</p>

<p>A spring lightning-arrester is shown in <a href="#FigIII25">Fig. 25</a>; it is
simply a modified form of that shown and described in <a href="#FigIII19">Fig.
19</a>. The base-block is five by one-and-a-quarter by five-eighths
of an inch, and is properly protected by a sheet of
mica or asbestos. The two metal plates are cut for the
binding-posts and screwed in place with screws, burrs, and
screw-eyes. From spring-brass wire bend a hook and slip
one end of it under the screw-head at the left side of the
block. From a longer piece of wire make two or three
turns around a piece of wood half an inch in diameter; then
form a hook at one end and a turn at the other, so that it
can be made fast under the screw-head of the binding-post.
When at rest, the spring-hook should stand in an upright
position, but when sprung and tied it occupies the position
shown in the drawing. The spring-hook is to be bent down
so that the two hooks are brought within an inch of each
other. They are held in this position with a piece of lead<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
fuse-wire. This last is given a turn about the hooks and
one or two turns about itself, close to each hook, to prevent
the spring from tearing itself away. When the wire is fused
by a current the spring-hook flies up and away from possible
contact with the short hook attached to the opposite binding-post.
This is the construction for a single-pole-spring
lightning-arrester; a double one is made in a similar manner,
and the parts mounted on a wider block, as shown in
<a href="#FigIII20">Fig. 20</a>.</p>

<p>For doubtful currents, where there is no means of knowing
how strong they are, a combined fuse and single-pole
switch is shown in <a href="#FigIII26">Fig. 26</a>. This is nothing more than a
combination of the apparatus shown in <a href="#FigIII21">Fig. 21</a>, and the
single-pole switch (<a href="#FigIII10">Fig. 10</a>). The base block is seven inches
long and two inches wide. Or it may be made half an inch
wider if it is to be bevelled at the top, as shown in the drawing.
It should be three-quarters of an inch thick and provided
with two countersunk holes for screws that will hold
it in place on a ledge or against a casement. The little
angles to hold the copper-ended mica fuse-plate are described
for the apparatus pictured in <a href="#FigIII21">Fig. 21</a>. If it is desired
that one of the ends should be provided with burrs and a
screw-eye, the little plate of brass should be an inch long and
an inch wide, with a half-inch-square piece snipped from
one corner, as shown at A in <a href="#FigIII26">Fig. 26</a>. It is provided with
two holes, and then bent on the dotted line, so that the part
with the holes will lie on the block and the ear will stand in
a vertical position. A reverse-plate made on this pattern
will act as one side of the switch-bar clutch at the opposite
end of the block. For the metal clutch and keeper at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
middle of the block the metal plate (before it is bent) will
appear as shown at B in <a href="#FigIII26">Fig. 26</a>. The long plate with two
holes lies on the base, while the first ear (or the one without
the hole) forms part of the clutch for the fuse end, the ear
with the hole acting as one side of the bar-lever strap. An
opposite plate to this forms the other side of the clutch and
strap, and the two plates are screwed side by side, so that
the fuse-plate will be held securely when pushed into place.</p>

<p>For the switch-bar use a piece of hard copper or brass
four inches long, half an inch wide, and about one-eighth of
an inch thick, or the same thickness as the copper straps at
the ends of the mica fuse-plate. Bore a hole at one end of
this bar, and with a copper rivet attach it between the two
upright ears at the middle of the block. With a file cut
away the two edges at the other end of the bar for a distance
of an inch, so that the bar will have an end as shown at C
in <a href="#FigIII26">Fig. 26</a>. Drive a small file-handle on this end and give
it a coat or two of shellac; then bevel the lower edges of
the bar with a file where it enters between the blades of the
clutch. The circuit wires are made fast at both ends of the
block, and the current travels through the binding-posts,
the lead fuse-wire on the mica plate D, and the switch-bar.
If the current is too strong, then when the switch-bar is
pushed into the clutch the safety-fuse will burn out and
save the apparatus; or it will arrest a flash of lightning.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">MAGNETS AND INDUCTION-COILS</span></h3>

<h4>Simple and Horseshoe Magnets</h4>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">E</span><span class="afterlargecap">very</span>
boy has a horseshoe magnet among his collection
of useful odds and ends, and whether it is a large or
small one its working principle is the same. If large enough
it will lift a jack-knife, nails, or solid weights, such as a
small flat-iron or an iron padlock. A horseshoe magnet is
made of highly tempered steel and magnetized so that one
end is a north pole and the other a south pole. In more
scientific language these poles are known as, respectively,
positive and negative. Once magnetized the instrument
retains that property indefinitely, unless the power is drawn
from it by exposure to intense heat, and even then, by successive
heating and cooling, the magnetism may be partially
restored.</p>

<p>An electro-magnet may be made of any scrap of soft
iron, from a piece of ordinary telegraph-wire to a gigantic
iron shaft. When a current of electricity passes through a
wire a magnetic “field” is produced around the wire, and
if the latter is insulated with a covering and coiled about a
soft iron object, such as a nail, a bolt, or a rod, that object
becomes a magnet so long as a current of electricity is passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span>
through the coils of wire or helix. A coil of wire in the
form of a spiral spring has a stronger field than a straight
wire carrying the same current, for each turn or convolution
adds its magnetic field to that of the other turns.</p>

<p>A simple form of electro-magnet is made by winding
several layers of No. 20 insulated copper wire around a
stout nail or a carriage-bolt; by connecting the ends to a
battery of sufficient power, some very heavy objects may
be lifted. A single magnet, like the one shown in <a href="#FigIV1">Fig. 1</a>,
is made with a piece of soft iron rod six inches long and
half an inch in diameter, the ends of a large spool sawed off
and worked on the rod, and half a pound of No. 20 insulated
copper wire. The spool-ends are arranged as shown in
<a href="#FigIV2">Fig. 2</a>. An end of the wire is passed through a hole in one
flange when you begin to wind the coils, and when finished,
the other end is passed through a hole at the outer rim of the
same flange. This magnet may be held in the hands when
in use; or a hand-magnet may be constructed of a longer
piece of iron on one end of which a handle is driven and
held in place with a nut and washer, as shown in <a href="#FigIV3">Fig. 3</a>.
The wires from the coil pass through holes made in the
handle and come out at the butt end, where they may be
attached by connectors to the pole-wires of a battery. To
protect the outer insulated coil of wire from chafing and a
possible short-circuit, it would be well to wrap several
thicknesses of stout paper around the coil and glue it fast;
or a leather cover will answer as well.</p>

<p class="caption">SIMPLE AND HORSESHOE MAGNETS</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span></p>

<p>A more powerful magnet may be made from a stout bolt,
two nuts, and a wooden base, with about three-quarters of
a pound of No. 18 insulated copper wire to wind about the
body of the bolt. A block of wood an inch thick, four
inches wide, and six inches long is provided with a hole at
the middle for the bolt to pass through. A larger hole is
made at the under side of the block so that a nut can be
easily turned in it. A three-quarter-inch machine-bolt,
with a square head, and seven inches long, is set in the
block, head up, as shown in <a href="#FigIV4">Fig. 4</a>; and composition or thin
wooden disks or washers are placed on the bolt to hold the
coils of wire in place. The ends of the wire pass out through
the bottom washer and are made fast to binding-posts on
the block, and to these latter the battery-poles are made
fast when the magnet is in use. Coils of wire may be wound
on an ordinary spool, and the hole in the middle may be
filled with lengths of soft iron wire. When a current is
passing around the spool the wires become highly magnetic,
but lose the magnetism directly the current ceases.</p>

<p>Horseshoe electro-magnets are made by winding coils on
the ends of <span class="symbol">U</span>-shaped pieces of soft iron, but the winding
must be done so that the current will pass around them in
opposite directions, otherwise you would have two negatives
instead of a negative and positive. For a small
horseshoe magnet a stout iron staple may be used, but for
the larger magnets it would be best to have a blacksmith
bend a piece of round iron in the desired shape.</p>

<p>A powerful horseshoe magnet may be made from a piece
of tire-iron bent as shown in <a href="#FigIV5">Fig. 5</a> A; when wound with
No. 18 wire it will appear like <a href="#FigIV5">Fig. 5</a> B. A volt or two of
current passing through the coils will render this magnet
powerful enough to lift several pounds.</p>

<p>For bells, telegraph-sounders, and other electrical equipment<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
requiring the horseshoe or double magnet, several
kinds may be used, but the simplest is constructed from
two carriage or machine bolts and a yoke of soft iron, as
shown in <a href="#FigIV6">Fig. 6</a>. The yoke is five-eighths of an inch in
width, two inches and a half long, and provided with two
three-eighths-inch holes, one inch and a half apart from
centre to centre. Two-inch carriage or machine bolts are
used, and they should be three-eighths of an inch in diameter.
The nuts are turned on the thread far enough to
admit the yoke, and then another nut is applied to hold it
in place and bind the three pieces into one compact mass.
Wooden spool-ends or composition washers are placed on
the bolts to hold the ends of the wire coils in place, and
the winding may be done on each bolt separately and
locked to the yoke after the winding is completed. Double
cotton-insulated No. 20 or 22 copper wire should be used
for the coils.</p>

<p>It is a tedious and bothersome job to wind a coil by hand,
and if possible a winder should be employed for this purpose.
Several varieties of winders are on the market, but
a simple one for ordinary spools may be made from a stick
held in an upright piece of wood with staples. This idea is
pictured in <a href="#FigIV7">Fig. 7</a>, where the round stick is shown cut with
two grooves into which the staples fit. One end of the stick
is made with a square shoulder, so that a handle and crank
can be fitted to it. A few wraps of wire are taken around
the crank to prevent it from splitting, and it is held to the
round stick with a slim steel nail. The opposite end of the
round stick is shaved off so that it will fit snugly in the hole
of a spool; if it should be too small for some spools, a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
turns of cord around the small end will make it bind. The
block to which the shaft and crank is attached may be held
in a vise or screwed to the edge of a table.</p>

<h4>Induction-coils</h4>

<p>A simple induction or shocking coil may be made of a
two-and-one-half by five-sixteenths-inch bolt, a thin wooden
spool, and two sizes of insulated copper wire. An induction-coil
is a peculiar and wonderful apparatus; it figures largely
in electrical experimenting and is a part of every complete
equipment.</p>

<p>A piece of curtain-pole may be used for the spool. First
bore a five-sixteenths-inch hole through the wood to receive
the bolt; then in a lathe turn it down into a spool with less
than one-eighth of an inch of wood about the hole and with
flanges about one-eighth of an inch in thickness. Smooth
the spool with sand-paper, while it is still in the lathe, and
give it a thin coat or two of shellac.</p>

<p>Slip the spool on the winder (<a href="#FigIV7">Fig. 7</a>) and wind on three
layers of No. 24 cotton-insulated copper wire, taking care
to wrap the coils evenly and close. Bring six inches of the
ends out at either end of the spool through small holes
pierced in the flanges; then wrap several thicknesses of
brown paper around the coil. A current passing around
this three-layer coil will magnetize the bolt. This is the
primary coil and the one through which the battery current
will pass.</p>

<p>A secondary coil is now made over the primary one with
eleven or thirteen layers of No. 30 insulated copper wire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
It will take some time to carefully put on these layers, and
when doing so mark down each layer so as to keep an accurate
count, for there must be the right number of layers to
make the coil act properly. No. 30 wire is quite fine, and
if the layers are not inclined to lie smooth, make a wrap or
two of brown paper between each three layers. Bring six
inches of each end of the wire out from the flanges of the
spool, and to protect the outer coil wrap paper about the
coils and attach it fast with thread or paraffine. Slip the
bolt through the hole and screw the nut on the threaded
end. Cut out a wooden block four inches long, three inches
wide, and three-quarters of an inch thick, and with two thin
metal straps and screws attach the coil to the middle of the
block, as shown in <a href="#FigIV8">Fig. 8</a>. Make four binding-posts and
screw them fast at the corners, and to A and B of <a href="#FigIV8">Fig. 8</a>
attach the ends of the heavy wire from the primary coil,
and to C and D of <a href="#FigIV8">Fig. 8</a> the ends of the fine wire from the
secondary coils. The induction-coil is now ready for any
use to which it may be put, and by mounting it on the block
with the delicate wire ends attached to the binding-posts,
it is in less danger of damage than if the wire ends were left
loose for rough-and-ready connections.</p>

<p>In order to get a shock from this coil it will be necessary
to have a pair of handles and a current interrupter. The
handles may be made from two pieces of tin rolled into the
form of cylinders to which wires are soldered. Or, better
yet, use pieces of thin brass tubing an inch in diameter.
The buzzer shown in <a href="#FigIV9">Fig. 9</a> may be employed for a current
interrupter, and a bichromate battery will furnish the current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span></p>

<p>In order to make the connections, the wires from the
handles are attached to the binding-posts C and D in <a href="#FigIV8">Fig. 8</a>&mdash;that
is, to the wires of the secondary coil. One spool of
the battery is connected with A of <a href="#FigIV8">Fig. 8</a> and the other
with A of <a href="#FigIV9">Fig. 9</a>. A wire connects C of <a href="#FigIV9">Fig. 9</a> with B of <a href="#FigIV8">Fig. 8</a>,
and the circuit is closed. The buzzer now begins to vibrate,
and any one holding the handles will receive a shock the
intensity of which depends on the strength of the batteries.
A switch should be introduced somewhere in the circuit, so
that it may be opened or closed at will; a good place for it
is between a battery-pole and the binding-post A in <a href="#FigIV8">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<p id="Ref001">If the shock is too intense it may be weakened by drawing
the carbon and zinc poles partly out of the bichromate
solution; or a regulator may be made of a large glass tube
and a glass preserving-jar filled with water. If the tube
cannot be had, an Argand gas-burner chimney will answer
as well.</p>

<p>Solder a wire to the edge of a small tin or copper disk, as
shown in <a href="#FigIV10">Fig. 10</a>, on which the chimney rests at the bottom
of the jar, and another wire to a tin box-cover with some
small holes punched in its top, this latter being suspended
within the chimney. This second wire is passed out through
a cork at the top of the chimney made of a disk of cardboard
and a piece of wood. One wire is connected with A
of <a href="#FigIV8">Fig. 8</a> and the other with a battery-pole. This apparatus
acts the same as a resistance-coil, and by raising or lowering
the box-cover the current is increased or diminished. The
closer the cover comes to the disk the stronger the current,
as there is less water for the electricity to pass through and
therefore less resistance; while if the cover touches the disk<span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span>
the current flows as freely as if there were no regulator and
the wires ran directly to the cell.</p>

<p>An apparatus comprising a coil, an interrupter, or armature,
and a switch may be set on one block, and the arrangement
of the several parts is clearly shown in the drawing of
the complete galvano-faradic apparatus (<a href="#FigIV11">Fig. 11</a>). The block
should be six inches long, four inches wide, and seven-eighths
of an inch in thickness.</p>

<p>The coil is made as described for <a href="#FigIV8">Fig. 8</a>, the spool being
three inches long and one inch and a quarter in diameter.
A carriage-bolt three inches and a half long and five-sixteenths<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
of an inch in diameter, with a bevelled head, is made
fast in the spool, and this coil is strapped to the block
with two metal bands and screws. Two binding-posts (A
and B of <a href="#FigIV11">Fig. 11</a>) are arranged at the upper corners, and to
these the ends of the secondary coil wires are attached.
Two more binding-posts (C and D of <a href="#FigIV11">Fig. 11</a>) are arranged
at the lower side and provided with a switch to open and
close the circuit. One of the primary coil wires is made
fast to C, and the other one to a block which contains the
set-screw that bears against the vibrating armature. Its
arrangement and the wire connection is explained in <a href="#FigIV9">Fig.
9</a> B.</p>

<p>An armature of thin brass or tin is made and attached
to a block (E in <a href="#FigIV11">Fig. 11</a>). At the loose end that is opposite
the bolt-head several wraps of tin are made and soldered
fast, or a small block of soft iron may be riveted to the
armature. It must be of iron or tin, however, so as to be
attracted by the electro-magnetized bolt-head. This arrangement
may be seen in <a href="#FigIV12">Fig. 12</a>. Attach a thick piece
of paper over the bolt-head, so that the lug at the end of the
armature will not adhere to it through residual magnetism.</p>

<p>In regular galvano-faradic machines the current regulator
is formed of a hollow cylinder which is drawn from the core
of the coil; but in this simple machine the water-jar regulator
may be connected between a pole of the battery and
the binding-posts (D or E of <a href="#FigIV11">Fig. 11</a>). The wires of the
handles are attached to posts (A and B of <a href="#FigIV11">Fig. 11</a>), and when
all the wires are in place and the current turned on by
means of the switch, the vibrator begins to work and the
shocking-current is felt through the handles. By means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
the regulating-screw that bears on the armature, the number
of vibrations may be increased or diminished, but for
faradic purposes the vibrations should be as quick as possible.
Much amusement may be had with this apparatus,
and a large number of people may be given a shock by getting
them to join hands when standing or sitting in a circle.</p>

<h4 id="Ref002">An Electric Buzzer</h4>

<p>This piece of apparatus is, in theory, nothing more than
the electric bell, and might properly be included in <a href="#Page78">Chapter
V.</a>, on Annunciators and Bells. But since it is the logical
development of principles just laid down, it has been thought
best to give it its present position.</p>

<p>The electric buzzer is constructed on the principle of the
telegraph-sounder, but instead of making a single click or
stroke the current is made to act on the armature and keep
up a continuous motion so long as the electricity passes
through the helix of the cores, the armature, and the contact-points
of the apparatus.</p>

<p>A buzzer has the same movement as an electric bell with
the ringing apparatus removed. For offices, houses, and
quiet calls it is often preferred to the loud ringing of a
bell.</p>

<p>The electric buzzer shown in <a href="#FigIV13">Fig. 13</a> is easy to make; it
is operated by the aid of a cell and a push-button. Cut a
base-block three inches and a half wide, five inches long,
and three-quarters of an inch thick, and mount a horseshoe
magnet made of bolts and a yoke and coils about at the
middle of it, as shown in <a href="#FigIV9">Fig. 9</a>. The magnet is held to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
base by a flat wooden cleat and a screw passed down through
a hole in the cleat and into the base, between the coils. An
armature of soft iron, two inches long and half an inch wide,
is riveted to a piece of spring-brass, as shown in <a href="#FigIV14">Fig. 14</a> A,
and the end is bent so that it will fit around the corner of a
block to which it is held fast with two screws. This armature
is mounted so that there is a space one-sixteenth of an
inch wide between it and the bolt-heads, as you can see
in <a href="#FigIV9">Fig. 9</a>. The brass is bent out slightly and runs parallel
with the armature for one inch and a quarter. Against this
the end of the screw mounted in block B <a href="#FigIV9">Fig. 9</a> rests.</p>

<div class="container m40">
<a id="FigIV13"></a>
<a id="FigIV14"></a>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo065.jpg" alt="Buzzers" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The block B is a small piece of hard-wood screwed fast to
the side of the base to hold the set-screw and also the wire
that comes from the outside of the upper coil. A small hole
is made in the edge of the block and the wire passed in, so
that the end rests in the screw-hole as shown by the dotted
line. When the screw is placed in the hole and turned, it
comes into contact with the wire and makes a connection.
This block and its attachment is shown in <a href="#FigIV14">Fig. 14</a> B.</p>

<p>On the base, near the armature-block, a binding-post is<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
made fast, and the current, passing in through the wire A
in <a href="#FigIV9">Fig. 9</a>, goes through the coils and around to the screw B,
then through the armature to the block, and out through
the wire C. In its circuit the bolts are magnetized, and they
draw the armature, but the instant they do so the loose
spring-brass end is pulled away from the screw-point B and
the circuit is broken, the bolts cease to be magnetized, and
the armature flies back under the influence of the spring-brass
neck at D. The loose brass end, on touching the
screw-point, conducts the current through the coils again,
with a continual vibrating action, so long as the electric
current is passing in at A and out at C. The greater the volume
of current the greater the number of vibrations, and to
properly regulate the contact the set-screw B must be adjusted
at the right point. Paste pieces of heavy paper over
the heads of the bolts to overcome residual magnetism.</p>

<p>A single electric bell is made the same as a buzzer, but
continuing on from the end of the armature a wire or rod is
mounted with a ball at the end which strikes the bell as the
current causes the armature to vibrate. The bell-block
may be made longer, and a bell from an old clock or a bicycle
should be mounted at the proper place on a wooden dowel
driven into the base. A screw passes through the hole at
the middle of the bell and into the top of the dowel. The
ball at the end of the rod may be made of brass with a hole
in it, and a drop of solder will hold it in place. Or it may
be made of wire wound round the end and soldered into a
compact mass.</p>

<h4>A Large Induction-coil</h4>

<p>As has been said, the induction-coil is one of the mysterious
phenomena of electrical science. While its practical
value is known and recognized in all branches of voltaic
electricity for use in transforming currents, its actual workings
have never been clearly explained.</p>

<p>The construction of a small induction-coil was explained
in the description of a shocker or medical battery. For
bigger equipments, wireless telegraphy and other uses, a
large induction-coil will be necessary, and the following
illustrations and descriptions should enable the young electrician
to construct an apparatus that will be both simple
and efficient in its working.</p>

<p>For the tube (in which to wind the primary coils) obtain
a piece of red fibre-tubing, one inch inside diameter and not
more than one-eighth of an inch in thickness. The length
should be ten inches. If fibre cannot be had use a paste-board
tube.</p>

<p>From white-wood, half an inch in thickness, saw two
blocks four inches square and in the centre of each cut a
hole so that the tube will pass through it and fit snugly.
Some shellac and a few slim brass escutcheon pins will hold
the blocks in place, as shown at <a href="#FigIV15">Fig. 15</a>. The wood blocks
and fibre or paper tube should be treated to several successive
coats of shellac to give them a good finish and prevent
the absorption of moisture. Four binding-posts, with
wood screw-ends, are to be made fast at the top edges of
the end-blocks, as shown at <a href="#FigIV15">Fig. 15</a>. Holes bored in the
blocks near the foot of the binding-posts will admit the<span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span>
ends of the coil-wires so that contact can be made. The
ends of the conductor-wires should then be placed in the
holes in the binding-posts and held in place with the thumb-screws.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The primary coil is made by winding four layers of No.
20 insulated copper wire on the tube and between the end-blocks,
as shown at <a href="#FigIV16">Fig. 16</a>. Each layer must be wound
evenly, and the strands should lie close to each other.
When the first layer is on give it a coat of shellac; then
wrap a piece of thin paper about it and give that also a coat
of shellac. When the second layer is on repeat the operation
of shellacking and paper-coating, and continue with the
third layer. When the fourth layer is on give the coil a
double wrap of paper and two or three coats of shellac to
thoroughly insulate it and keep out all moisture. The
winding may be done by hand, but it is much easier to do it
on a winder or reel, which can be operated to revolve the
core, the wire unwinding from its original spool as it is
wound on the tube.</p>

<p>A convenient winder may be made on a base-board<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
which can be clamped to a table or bench. The board is
twelve inches long, eight or ten inches wide, and seven-eighths
of an inch thick. Two uprights, three inches wide,
ten inches long, and three-quarters of an inch thick, are
screwed and glued to the ends of the base-board. A notch
is cut in the top of the end-boards, into which the spindle
or shaft can rest; and at the top of the end-pieces two
small plates of wood or metal are screwed down to hold
the spindle in place when the tube and ends are being
revolved. A small hole, bored in each upright end two
inches above the top of the base-board, will admit a rod on
which a spool of wire can revolve, as shown at <a href="#FigIV17">Fig. 17</a>.</p>

<p>Two plugs of wood, shaped like corks, are made to fit in
the ends of the fibre-tube. A hole is bored through each
one so that a wire or rod spindle will pass through them
and fit tightly. One end of the rod is bent and provided
with a small wooden handle, by means of which the core
may be revolved.</p>

<p>This winding-rack makes it easy to handle the core-tube
while putting on the layers of wire, and it holds the tube
securely while the wraps of paper and shellac are applied.</p>

<p>The secondary coil is laid over the primary, and should
be of Nos. 30 to 36 insulated copper wire. The finer the
wire the higher the resistance and the longer the spark, but
nothing heavier than No. 30 should be used.</p>

<p>Begin by making one end of the wire fast to a binding-post;
then turn the core-tube with one hand, holding the
wire in the other. Take care not to bind the wire nor
stretch it, but wind it on smoothly and evenly, like the
coils of thread on a new spool of cotton or silk. Be very<span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span>
careful to avoid kinks, breaks, or uninsulated places in the
wire. Should the wire become broken, give the coil a coat
of shellac to bind the wound strands; then make a fine
twisted point and cover it with the silk or cotton covering,
with a coat of shellac to hold it in place, and proceed with
the winding. Between each layer of wire place a thin sheet
of paper and coat it with paraffine, or shellac, to make a
perfect insulation; then proceed with the next layer.</p>

<p>With a battery and small bell test the wire layers occasionally
to see that everything is all right, and that there
are no breaks or short circuits. This is very necessary to
avoid making mistakes, and, considering the time and care
spent in winding the coils, it would be a great disappointment
if the coil were defective.</p>

<div class="container m40">
<a id="FigIV17"></a>
<a id="FigIV18"></a>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo070.jpg" alt="Coils" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>About one pound and a half of wire should constitute
the secondary coil, and, if possible, it is best to have it in
one continuous strand, without splices.</p>

<p>Over the last coil, after the winding is completed, several
thicknesses of paper should be laid and well coated with<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
shellac between each wrap. This is a protector to insure
the fine wire strands from damage. To improve the appearance
of the coil a wrap of thin black or colored leather
may be glued fast, with the seam or point at the under
side.</p>

<p>The ends of the wires forming the primary coil should
be made fast to the binding-posts at one end, while those
of the secondary coil should be attached to the posts at
the other end.</p>

<p>For the core, obtain some soft iron wire, about No. 18,
and cut a number of lengths. Straighten these short wires
and fill the tube with them, packing it closely, so that the
wires will remain in place under a mutual pressure. It is
better to make a core of a number of rods or wires rather
than to have it of one solid piece of soft iron.</p>

<p>Now, from hard-wood, cut a base three-quarters of an
inch thick, five or six inches wide, and twelve inches long.
Attach the coil to the base by means of screws passed up
through the board and into the lower edges of the end-blocks.
The wood is to be stained and given several successive
coats of shellac.</p>

<p>Now connect the wires of a battery to the binding-posts
in contact with the primary coil, and attach two separate
wires to the secondary coil binding-posts. Bring these ends
near to each other, and a spark will leap across from one
end to the other, its size or “fatness” depending on the
strength of the battery. The completed apparatus is shown
at <a href="#FigIV18">Fig. 18</a>.</p>

<p>In producing a long spark a condenser is an important
factor; it is used in series with an induction-coil. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
are several forms of condensers, but perhaps the simplest
and most efficient is the Fizeau condenser, which is made
up of layers of tin-foil with paraffined paper as separators.</p>

<p>From a florist’s supply-house purchase one hundred and
fifty sheets of tin-foil seven by nine inches, or sheets that
will cut to that size without waste; also ten or twelve
extra sheets for strips. At a paper supply-house obtain
some clear, thin, tough paper about the thickness of good
writing-paper. Be careful to reject any sheets that are perforated
or have any fine holes in them. The sheets should
be eight by ten inches, or half an inch larger all around
than those of the tin-foil. The paper must be thoroughly
soaked in hot paraffine to make it moisture-proof and a
perfect non-conductor. This is done by placing about two
hundred sheets on the bottom of a clean tin tray, or photographic
developing-dish of porcelain. Don’t use glass or
rubber. After placing some lumps of paraffine on the
paper, put the tray in an oven so as to dissolve the paraffine
and thoroughly soak the paper.</p>

<p>Open the oven door and, with a pin, raise up the sheets
one at a time, and draw them out of the liquid paraffine.
As soon as it comes in contact with cool air the paraffine
solidifies and the sheet of paper becomes stiffened. Select
each sheet with care, so that those employed for the condenser
are free from holes or imperfect places.</p>

<p>From pine or white-wood, a quarter of an inch in thickness,
cut two boards, eight by ten inches, and give them
several good coats of shellac.</p>

<p>To build up the condenser, lay one board on a table and
on it place two sheets of paraffined paper. On this lay a<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
sheet of tin-foil, arranging it so that half an inch of paper
will be visible around the margin. From the odd sheets
of tin-foil cut some strips, one inch in width and three inches
long. Place one of these strips at the left end of the first
sheet of foil, as shown at <a href="#FigIV19">Fig. 19</a>. Over this lay a sheet of
the paraffined paper, then another sheet of the foil. Now
on this second sheet of foil lay the short strip to the right
end, and so proceed until all the foil and paper is in place,
arranging each alternate short strip at the opposite end.
Care must be taken to observe this order if the condenser
is to be of any use.</p>

<div class="container m40">
<a id="FigIV19"></a>
<a id="FigIV20"></a>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo073.jpg" alt="Condensors" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>When the last piece of foil is laid on, with its short strip
above it, add two or three thicknesses of paper, and then
the other board. With four screw-clamps, one at each
corner, press together the mass of foil, paper, and boards as
closely as possible, then bind the boards about with adhesive
tape, or stout twine, and release the clamps. Attach
all the projecting ends of foil at one side by means of a
binding-post, and those at the other end with another
binding-post. The complete condenser will then appear
as shown in <a href="#FigIV20">Fig. 20</a>.</p>

<p>When in operation one wire leading from the secondary
coil should be connected with a binding-post of the condenser,
so that it is in series.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span></p>

<p>The object of the condenser is to increase the efficiency
of induction, and it should be made in proportion to the size
of the induction-coil with which it is to be employed.</p>

<h4>Circuit-Interrupters</h4>

<p>When an induction-coil is to be employed as a shocker
(and there is no vibrating armature arranged in connection
with the core), a circuit-interrupter must be employed to
get the effect of the pulsations, as given out by the secondary
coil when a current is passing through the primary.</p>

<p>There are various forms of circuit-breakers that may be
made for this purpose, but for really efficient service the type
shown in <a href="#FigIV21">Fig. 21</a> is perhaps the best that can be devised.</p>

<p>This interrupter consists of a metal cog-wheel with saw-teeth,
a pinion or axle, and a handle. Also a base-block,
with uprights to support it, and a piece of spring-brass wire,
arranged so as to bear against the wheel. When the wheel
is revolved the spring-wire will be driven out by each tooth;
and when released it flies back to the wheel, striking the
bevelled edge of a tooth at each trip.</p>

<p>Two binding-posts, arranged on the block, will provide
means of connecting in-and-out wires. With a coat or two
of shellac on the wood-work and black asphaltum varnish
on all surfaces of the metal that are not used for contact,
this circuit-interrupter will be ready for any use in connection
with an induction-coil.</p>

<p>The base-block is of pine, white-wood, or cypress, seven-eighths
of an inch thick, three inches wide, and five inches
long. The uprights, which support the wheel, are half an<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
inch thick and one inch wide. The wheel is three inches in
diameter and is made of brass one-sixteenth of an inch thick.
The design of the wheel should be laid out with a compass
and marked with lead-pencil or a sharp-pointed awl, which
will leave a mark clear enough to be seen when sawing and
filing the teeth and open places.</p>

<div class="container m40">
<a id="FigIV21"></a>
<a id="FigIV22"></a>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo075.jpg" alt="Interrupters" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A true plan is shown at <a href="#FigIV21">Fig. 21</a> A. Through the middle
of the wheel a small hole is bored to receive the axle of
brass which is to be soldered in place. When the wheel is
set up, a metal crank and wooden handle should be soldered
fast to one end of the axle. A piece of spring-brass wire is
fastened to the block, with a staple, and the lower end bent
so that the screw in one binding-post will hold it in place.
The upper end of the wire is bent in the form of an <span class="symbol">L</span>.
From the other binding-post, through the block and up one
support, a wire is passed, the end of which comes into contact
with the axle. The current, passing in through one
binding-post, is carried through this wire to the axle, then
to the wheel, and so on out through the spring-wire and
remaining binding-post. When in action the circuit is<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
constantly being broken, as the spring-wire jumps from the
end of one tooth back to the face of the next tooth. The
pulsations are increased or diminished by the fast or slow
speed of the wheel, as regulated by the hand motion. The
strength of the current is regulated by the force of the
battery and should be controlled by a water resistance, as
described for the medical battery, or shocking-coil.</p>

<p>The interrupter, shown in <a href="#FigIV22">Fig. 22</a>, is built up on a block
six inches square and seven-eighths of an inch thick.</p>

<p>A circle is cut from sheet-lead and laid on the face of the
block, through which pins, or steel-wire nails, are driven.
The lead circle is five inches in diameter and half an inch
in width, making the inside diameter four inches.</p>

<p>The pins or nails are driven a quarter of an inch apart,
and should be properly and accurately separated, so that
an even make-and-break will be the result.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to bore holes in the lead, but the pins
or nails should be driven clear through it, so that perfect
contact can be had by the metal parts coming together.
Otherwise the apparatus would be useless.</p>

<p>Over the circle of pins a brass bridge is erected, so that
the cross-strips will clear the heads of the pins. A hole is
bored at the middle of the bridge so that the revolving axle
will pass through it.</p>

<p>The axle is made from a piece of stout wire, or light rod,
and near the foot of it, and about half an inch above the
base-board, a disk of metal is soldered fast. A piece of
spring-brass wire is attached to this disk, so that when the
axle is turned the end of the wire trips from pin to pin, thus
making and breaking the circuit. The upper part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
axle is bent and provided with a small wooden or porcelain
knob.</p>

<p>One wire from the secondary coil is caught under a screw
that holds one end of the brass bridge to the base; and the
other to a screw, which may be placed at one corner of the
block, and from which a short wire leads to the lead ring.
Binding-posts may be arranged to serve the same purpose,
and, of course, they are much better than the screws, because
they can be easily operated by the fingers and do not
require a screw-driver every time the interrupter is placed
in series with an induction-coil. An interrupter on this
same order may be made from a straight strip of lead with
the pins driven through the middle of it. One wire from
the secondary coil is made fast to the lead plate, and the
end of the other wire is passed along the pins, thus making
and breaking the circuit in a primitive manner.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">ANNUNCIATORS AND BELLS</span></h3>

<h4>A Drum Sounder</h4>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">A</span> unique electric sounder that is sure to attract attention
is in the shape of an electric-bell apparatus, with
a drum sounder in place of a bell, or knockerless buzzer.
<a href="#FigV1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>The outfit is mounted on a block four inches and a half
wide and seven inches long. The cores and yoke are made
as described for the <a href="#Ref002">electric buzzer</a> (<a href="#Page54">chapter iv.</a>) and are
wound with No. 22 cotton-insulated wire. The magnet is
then strapped fast to the block by means of a hard-wood
plate having a screw passed down through it; and between
the coils and into the block an armature is made and
mounted on a metal plate, which in turn is screwed to the
block. Another block, with a contact-point, is arranged
to interrupt the armature, and the series is connected as
shown in the drawing <a href="#FigV1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>The end of the wire projecting above the armature is provided
with a hard-wood knocker which operates upon the
head of the drum. The drum is made from a small tin can,
having one or two small holes punched in the bottom. Over
the top a thin membrane, such as a bladder or a piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>
sheep-skin or cat-skin, is drawn and lashed fast with several
wraps of wire, having the ends twisted together securely.
The membrane must be wet when drawn over the can end,
and great care should be taken to get it tight and even.
Then, when it dries, it will stretch and draw, like a drumhead,
and hold its elastic, resonant surface so long as it does
not become moistened or wet.</p>

<p>This drum is arranged in the proper position and lashed
fast with wires passed over the box and down through holes
in the block; where, after several turns, the ends may be
securely twisted together. In place of the drum a small
wooden box may be lashed fast with its open end against
the block, so as to form a hollow enclosure. The raps of
the knocker against its sides will give forth a resonant
xylophone tone.</p>

<h4>An Annunciator</h4>

<p>A simple annunciator may be made from a core, a helix,
and some brass strips. A soft iron core, made of a piece of
three-eighth-inch round iron and threaded at one end, is
converted into a magnet by having a spool and wire coil
arranged to enclose it. This in turn is screwed into a strip
of brass bored and threaded to receive it. <a href="#FigV2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>This brass strip is shaped as shown at <a href="#FigV3">Fig. 3</a> A, and the
ears are bent to serve their several purposes. The lowest
ears are turned out and the lower part of the plate is bent
forward so as to form the hinge on which the drop-bar turns.
The drop-bar is only a strip of metal turned up at one end,
on which a numeral or letter can be attached; while at the
other the metal should be bent over so as to form a core into<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
which a pin or wire may be passed and the extending ends
bent down, after being caught through the holes in the ears.
Above the magnet the strip is bent forward and the top or
end ears bent up, so as to form the hinge on which the
armature swings. Holes are made in the long ears, through
which screws pass to hold the annunciator fast to the box
or wood-work.</p>

<p>The armature is made from a strip of brass and is shaped
like B in <a href="#FigV3">Fig. 3</a>. The two ears at the top are bent down
and fit within those at the top of the first strip. A screw
or wire passed through the holes in the ears will complete
the hinge. The strip is bent down so as to fall in front of
the magnet, and to its inner side a button or disk of sheet-iron
is riveted fast, so as to form an attraction-plate to be
drawn against the magnet when the current is passing
around it. The lower part of the armature is bent in hook
fashion so as to hold up the drop-bar.</p>

<p>A slot is cut in the drop-bar through which the hooked
end will project. A short spring is arranged at the top of
the annunciator so as to keep the bar and the hook in place
when not in action. The current passing around the soft
iron core magnetizes it and draws the iron button on the
armature towards it. This action immediately releases the
hook from under the edge of the metal at the forward end
of the slot, and the bar drops, bringing the figure down and
into plain sight. It is necessary, of course, to mount this
annunciator so that the bar will not drop down too far.
This may be done by having a platform or wire run
along under a series of the drops, so that they will rest
on it.</p>

<p class="caption">ANNUNCIATORS AND BELLS</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span></p>

<h4>A Double Electric Bell</h4>

<p>For loud ringing, and to get the benefit of both the forward
and backward stroke of the knocker, a double bell,
similar to the one shown in <a href="#FigV4">Fig. 4</a>, may be constructed upon
the general principle of the single-stroke buzzer already described
(<a href="#Page54">chapter iv.</a>).</p>

<p>Two soft iron cores are made, as described for the other
bells, but instead of being yoked together with iron, so that
the three parts will form a horseshoe magnet, the yoke is of
brass or copper. Each core will then be an independent
magnet.</p>

<p>The spools are wound with No. 22 insulated wire and the
ends left free, so that the coils are not connected together.
If the drawing is examined closely you will see that the
armature swings on a pivot at the base of the knocker-bar.
When the bell is not in action the knocker might rest naturally
against one bell or the other; or it might stand in the
centre and not touch a contact-point, were it not for the
small spring which draws it to the left. Directly the current
is run through the coils it alternately magnetizes first
one and then the other. This action is due to the making
and breaking of the circuit by the spring on the armature.
It first comes into contact with one point, and then is drawn
away from it to come into contact with the other. <a href="#FigV4">Fig. 4</a>
shows the knocker-bar at rest between both bells and the
armature unattracted by either magnet. This position is
purposely given so as to indicate the balance of the armature
and the spaces between it and the cores and also the contact-points
above it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span></p>

<p>The small, light wire spring shown in the drawing draws
the knocker to one side; therefore, when at rest, one circuit
is closed. Otherwise the bell would not act when the current
is run through the parts&mdash;in fact, the current could not
run through at all, if one or the other contact were not made.</p>

<p>The magnets are held fast to a base with a long screw and
a small plate of wood laid across them as shown in <a href="#FigV4">Fig. 4</a>.
The armature is a piece of soft iron one-eighth of an inch
thick, half an inch wide, and three inches long. This has a
spring-brass piece attached to it as shown at A A in <a href="#FigV5">Fig. 5</a>.
Small holes are bored through the strip and the iron, and
escutcheon pins are passed through and riveted. A small
hole is made down through the middle of the iron plate and
a pin is driven into it, so that a quarter of an inch projects
at both sides.</p>

<p>Another hole is made through the side of the plate for
the knocker-bar. Then the armature is set in place so that
there is a space of one-eighth of an inch between it and the
magnet ends. The armature is held in place at the top by
a bent metal strip (B B in <a href="#FigV5">Fig. 5</a>). This is screwed fast to
the base and the bottom is countersunk into the wood.</p>

<p>Two contact-points (C C in <a href="#FigV5">Fig. 5</a>) are arranged so that
when a magnet draws the armature down it brings the
opposite end of the armature spring into contact with a
point.</p>

<p>The wiring is at the under side of the base and is shown
in <a href="#FigV6">Fig. 6</a>. The current enters binding-post A, and passes
around coil and magnet No. 1 by entering at B and leaving
at C; from thence to D, entering the armature spring at E,
when the small spring has drawn the knocker-bar over to<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
the left. The current passes along the armature and out at
F; then along to binding-post G, and so on around through
battery K and push-button L, thus completing the circuit.
Directly that this is done the magnet draws the spring end
of the armature away from contact-point D and up against
contact-point J, so that the circuit is broken through coil
No. 1 and is sent through coil No. 2. This immediately
magnetizes core No. 2 and draws the armature down to it,
breaking its contact with J and re-establishing it with D.
The rapid alternate making and breaking of the circuit, and
the rapid and strong motion of the armature in its seesaw
action, causes the knocker to rap the bells soundly each time
it travels from right to left and back again.</p>

<p>Two bells of similar size, or two drums or wooden boxes,
may be employed for this double striker, and the more current
that is run through the coils the more power and a corresponding
increase of noise.</p>

<h4>An Electric Horn</h4>

<p>One of the most useful pieces of apparatus where a loud
noise is required (such as in a motor-boat or an automobile)
is the electric horn.</p>

<p>It is a rearranged principle of the telephone, for instead
of sound entering or striking against the membrane or
tympanum to be transmitted elsewhere, the disturbance
takes place within the horn and the sound is emitted.</p>

<p>Everybody has been close to a telephone when others
have been using it, and has heard noises, rasping sounds,
and even the voice of the speaker at the other end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
line. If a cornet were played at the other end of the line
it could be distinctly heard through the receiver by many
persons in the room, since its vibrations are loud enough
to set up a forcible succession of sound-waves.</p>

<p>The same principle operates in the electric horn, but
instead of being agitated at a long distance it is done within
the enclosure, and a very much louder vibration is consequently
produced.</p>

<p>It is quite as easy to make an electric horn as to construct
a bell, but care must be exercised to have the parts fit
accurately and the wiring properly done. If the drawings
are studied and the description closely followed, there is no
reason why a horn cannot be made that will demand any
one’s attention from some distance away.</p>

<p>The complete horn is shown in the illustration <a href="#FigV7">Fig. 7</a>,
and as it is made of wood it is easily attached with screws
to a boat or a motor-car.</p>

<p>From white-wood, half an inch thick, cut two blocks three
inches and a quarter square. In one of them (the rear one)
bore a hole at the centre, of such size that a piece of three-eighth-inch
gas-pipe can be screwed into it. In the other
one make a hole two inches in diameter, so that the cover
of a small tin can will fit into it. Outside this hole, and on
one side of the block, cut the wood away and down for one-eighth
of an inch, forming a rabbet, as shown at A in <a href="#FigV7">Fig. 7</a>.
This will be the back of the front block.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span></p>

<p>Have a gas or steam fitter cut a piece of two-inch iron
pipe one inch and three-quarters long. This will measure
a trifle over two inches and a quarter, outside diameter, and
will form the cylinder or cover for the mechanism. The
piece of pipe should fit snugly in the front board, and at
the rear one the wood should be cut away so as to let it in
an eighth of an inch, as shown in the sectional plan of
<a href="#FigV7">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<p>Obtain a piece of three-eighth-inch gas-pipe, threaded at
one end. Cut it with a hack-saw, and file the blunt end so
that it will measure one inch and seven-eighths long, as
shown at C in <a href="#FigV7">Fig. 7</a>. This is to be screwed into the front
of the rear block so that it will project one inch and a half.</p>

<p>Make a spool to fit the pipe, as shown at B in <a href="#FigV7">Fig. 7</a>, or
use two wooden button-moulds attached to the pipe with
shellac or glue. Between them wind on the coils of No. 22
wire to form the helix.</p>

<p>Cut a hole in the tin-can cover, as shown at D in <a href="#FigV7">Fig. 7</a>,
and have a tinsmith solder a small funnel to it (for the horn,
or bell, as it is called), cutting away the lower part of the
funnel so that the hole in it will correspond in size with
that in the can cover.</p>

<p>This joint can be made at home by fitting the funnel in
the hole and then turning back the edge, as shown in the
sectional drawing at E in <a href="#FigV7">Fig. 7</a>. Then, with a spirit-lamp,
some soldering solution, and solder, make a good joint.</p>

<p>Small holes are to be made at the corners of the blocks,
through which stove-bolts two inches and a half long will
fit to bind the front, back, and cylinder together.</p>

<p>Select a good, clean, and flat piece of tin and cut a disk
two inches and a quarter in diameter, and through the middle
make a small hole. Cut two pieces of iron about the
size and thickness of a cent, and bore a small hole through
the centre of each. Obtain a piece of stout brass wire, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
thin rod, and file one end of it as shown at G in <a href="#FigV7">Fig. 7</a>, so
that the small end will fit in the holes made in the iron
buttons. Place one button on either side of the tin disk, and
pass the wire through; then clamp it in a vise and rivet the
top of the rod so that you will have a disk with a button at
each side of the centre and all attached firmly to a brass
rod, as shown at F in <a href="#FigV7">Fig. 7</a>. The total length of this rod
should be two inches and a half, and the lower end is to be
threaded and provided with two small brass nuts. A piece
of spring-brass three-eighths or half an inch wide is made
fast to a small block at the back of the horn, as shown at H
in <a href="#FigV7">Fig. 7</a>, and at its opposite end a contact-piece of metal,
bent at an angle, is screwed fast. Around the back of the
back block a wooden frame is attached to protect the rear
mechanism of the horn.</p>

<p>The parts are now ready to assemble. First see that the
metal angle contact-point is in place with the long brass
strip resting on it, and that this in turn is properly fastened
to the block on the side opposite the contact-point, as shown
at H in <a href="#FigV7">Fig. 7</a>. There should be a small hole through the
middle of the brass strip directly in line with the middle
of the hole in the gas-pipe. Place this back-board
down on the table so that it will lie in a position as indicated
in the sectional plan of <a href="#FigV7">Fig. 7</a>. The gas-pipe is then to be
screwed onto the plate. Over this the spool with its layers
of wire is to be slipped and made fast, and the cylinder of
iron is then placed in position. Over this the disk F is laid,
so that the brass rod extends down through the pipe and
brass strip; then the nut is screwed on to hold it in place.
Next comes the front block, with its horn or bell, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span>
entire mass is locked together by means of the four bolts at
the corners.</p>

<p>The wiring is simple. One inlet being through block I,
the current passes through strip J to contact-point K; then
through the coil and out at wire L. The inlet and outlet
wires are connected to a battery and to a push-button or
switch, so that the horn can be operated. The proper adjustment
of this horn depends on the nuts at the foot of the
brass rod. They must be screwed on tight enough to draw
the strip J so that it rests on the contact-point K.</p>

<p>The current, passing in at I, through J, K, the coil, and
out at L, magnetizes the piece of pipe and draws the iron
buttons or disks attached to the tin disk. But so soon as
it does so it breaks the contact between J and K, and the
buttons fly back into place, having been drawn there by the
rigidity of the tin disk to which they are attached. Again
the current is closed and the magnet draws the iron buttons.
The brass rod moves but a very slight distance up and down&mdash;enough,
however, to make and break the contact between
J and K. As a result of this rapid movement and the consequent
snapping of the tin disk, a loud noise is emitted
through the bell, which can be heard a long distance and
closely resembles a long blast blown on a fish-horn.</p>

<h4>Burglar-alarms</h4>

<p>A unique burglar-alarm trap may be made from a plate
of wood, five by six inches and half an inch thick, a movable
lever, and a brass strip having the ends turned out.
These are arranged as shown in <a href="#FigV8">Fig. 8</a>. The brass strip is<span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span>
fastened to the plate with screws, and the ends extend out
for half an inch from the board. The lever is made from a
strip of brass, and the upper part is bent out so as to clear
the strip and screws that are under it. A hole is made at
the lower end of the lever, through which a brass ring and
the end of a spring may be fastened. The opposite end of
the spring is attached to a screw, and a wire carried from it
to a binding-post, A. Another wire connects the back plate
with binding-post B. A string or piece of fine picture-wire
is made fast to the ring and carried to any part of a room.</p>

<p>To set the trap, make the block fast in any convenient
place, such as the door-casing or the surbase, and carry the
string out from the trap and fasten the end of it. Any one
running against it in the dark will draw the lever over to
the right side and connect the circuit.</p>

<div class="container">
<a id="FigV8"></a>
<a id="FigV9"></a>
<a id="FigV10"></a>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo090.jpg" alt="Burglar alarm" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>When setting the trap, have the string adjusted so that
the lever is in a vertical position, as shown in the drawing
of <a href="#FigV8">Fig. 8</a>. When the string is disturbed it will pull the top<span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span>
of the lever over to the right side; but if the string is broken
by the person running against it, the spring attached to the
bottom of the lever draws it over to the right side with a
snap, and the top of the lever goes to the left side, when the
circuit is closed and the alarm given.</p>

<p>This trap is connected the same as a push-button, one
wire leading to the bell, the other to the battery; then the
battery and bell are connected together so that when the
circuit is closed the bell will ring until some one throws a
switch open to break it.</p>

<p>Another form of circuit-closer is shown in the door-trap
(<a href="#FigV9">Fig. 9</a>). This is a wooden block that rests on the floor close
to the bottom of a door, and is held in place by means of
four sharp-pointed nails driven down through the corners
of the block. The points should project a quarter of an
inch or more, according to whether the block is on a hard
floor or on a carpet. The front edge of the block is bevelled
so that the bottom of a door that fits closely to the
floor will pass over it.</p>

<p>The block is five by seven inches, and three-quarters of an
inch thick. At the left side a strip of metal (A) is held close
to the block with straps or wide staples driven over it, but
not so close but that it can move freely back and forth. To
the front end a round piece of wood is made fast. This is
the bumper against which the door will strike when opened.
At the middle of the strip a screw is riveted fast; or it may
be a machine-screw let into a threaded hole in the metal.
At the right side of the block another strip of metal (B) is
attached, but this is held fast with a screw at the middle
and a screw-eye and washer at the rear end to act as a binding-post.<span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span>
The front end of this strip is turned up so as to
form a stop; then a movable lever (C) mounted over both
strips, with one end bent up, is attached to the block with a
screw. A slot is cut at one end so that the screw in the
movable strip (A) will move freely in it, and near the other
end a small hole is made to receive the end of a spiral spring
(D). To set the trap, the block is placed on the floor and
the wires from battery and bell are made fast to the binding-posts.
The spring D keeps the lever C away from the
strip-end B, while at the same time it throws the strip A
forward. When the door is opened it shoves the bumper
and strip A back through the staples, while the screw operates
lever C and causes its loose end to come into contact
with the end B, thereby closing the circuit and ringing the
bell or buzzer. When the door is closed again the spring
draws lever C away from B, and the circuit is opened.</p>

<p>The block acts as an obstruction as well as an alarm, for
the pins will hold in the floor and the little block will stand
its ground. A simple form of contact for doors is shown
at <a href="#FigV10">Fig. 10</a>. This is simply two strips of spring-brass bent
as shown, and screwed fast on either side the crack of a
door, at the hinge side, so that when the door is opened
one piece of metal bears on the other and the circuit is
closed. This is to be operated in connection with a switch,
so that the circuit may be opened in the daytime when the
door is in use.</p>

<h4>Signals and Alarms</h4>

<p>There are many different kinds of electric call-signals
used in and about the house; among these are some that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
boy can readily make&mdash;for example, the ordinary call-buttons
and the signals between house and stable or other
out-buildings.</p>

<p>A portable call-bell, or alarm, is one of the most convenient
things in any home. It may be temporarily rigged
up from one room to another, or from one floor to the next,
the small, flexible wire being run over the tops of door-casings,
where it is held by slim nails or pins driven into
the wood-work.</p>

<p>The main terminal of this portable outfit consists of a
wooden box that will hold a large dry-cell, and to the side of
which an electric bell or buzzer may be attached. Binding-posts
are arranged at another side, to which the ends of the
flexible wire-cord can be made fast, and a cover fitted to the
box to hide the battery and wiring. The complete outfit,
except the flexible wire-cord and push-button, will appear
as shown in <a href="#FigV11">Fig. 11</a>. No definite size can be laid down for
the construction of this box, as dry-cells vary in size and
shape, some being long and thin, while others are short and
fat. By removing the cover and looking into the box, it
will appear as shown in <a href="#FigV12">Fig. 12</a>. The carbon is connected
with one binding-post and the zinc to one of the poles of
the bell. The other bell-pole is connected with the remaining
binding-post, and it requires but a switch or push-button
to close the circuit between the two binding-posts. This is
done by the long line of flexible wire-cord, which may be of
the silk or cotton covered kind, having the two strands
twisted together as is customary with flexible electric-light
wire. A pear-shaped push-button may be connected at
the end of the line, and this may be arranged at the head<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
of a bed or on a chair placed conveniently near an invalid’s
couch.</p>

<p>This same apparatus is a very convenient thing for a
lecturer where a stereopticon is used. A buzzer takes the
place of the bell, which would be too loud in a hall or
lecture-room, and the cord, passing from the apparatus
close to the operator, is hung over the lecturer’s stand, or
the button held by him in the hand, to be pressed whenever
he desires the pictures changed.</p>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo094.jpg" alt="Buzzers" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>This apparatus can be used also in connection with an
alarm-clock, where the winding-key is exposed at the back,
as it is in most of the nickel-cased clocks that are operated
by a spring and which have to be wound each day. For this
purpose obtain a piece of hard rubber or fibre, one-sixteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
of an inch thick, an inch long, and half an inch wide. A
piece of stout card-board or a thin piece of hard-wood soaked
in hot paraffine will answer just as well, if the fibre or rubber
cannot be had. Bore a small hole at the two upper corners
and one at the middle near the lower edge. Obtain three
garter-clips, with springs, and rivet one of them fast to the
little plate of non-conducting material. Cut two lengths of
old brass watch-chain, four inches long, or obtain eight
inches of chain at a hardware-store, and divide it in
half. Attach a garter-clip to one end of each piece, and
make the other end fast in the holes at the corners of
the small plate as shown in <a href="#FigV13">Fig. 13</a>. This will be the connector
and will close the circuit when the alarm goes
off.</p>

<p>When the clock is wound and the alarm-spring is tight,
catch one binding-post with a clip at the end of a chain
and the other post with the remaining clip. Place the clock
near the box and grasp the alarm-key with the clip on the
plate. When the alarm goes off the bell on the clock will
begin to ring, and when the key has made one revolution it
twists the two pieces of chain together, closes the circuit,
and the electric bell rings until some one unfastens one of
the clips on the binding-posts and breaks the circuit. The
great advantage in this double-alarm outfit is that it keeps
the bell ringing until the attention of the sleeper is attracted.
The bell on the clock will stop ringing directly the spring
is unwound or run down; but in so doing it twists the
chain and sets the electric mechanism in motion, to run
until it is stopped, or until the battery polarizes or is exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span></p>

<h4>A Dining-table Call</h4>

<p>One of the most convenient of house electric-calls is that
between the dining-room and the butler’s pantry or the
kitchen, its purpose being to summon the waitress without
the necessity of ringing a bell at the table, or calling.</p>

<p>There are various forms of push-buttons for this purpose&mdash;some
embedded in the floor, others hanging from the
centre light, and others again where the wire runs up from
under the table, and the pear-shaped push rests on the cloth
within easy reach. These last are good enough in their way,
but are inconvenient, unsightly, and quite liable to get out
of order.</p>

<p>In order to use the floor-push the table must stand in
exactly the right place; with the drop-string from a chandelier
the cord is continually getting in the way; and as for
the portable push that comes from under the table, one
must be forever hunting for the button every time the table
is set. And yet it is quite possible to avoid all these troubles
and construct an apparatus that is always in order and
always available, wherever the table may be placed. A
visitor at a certain house noticed that the number of the
family present at a meal was apt to vary largely, necessitating
frequent lengthenings and shortenings of the table.
And yet the waitress invariably appeared just at the right
time, and whether one end or the other of the table was to
be served, she was always on the spot where she was needed.
The visitor tried to study it out, but was finally obliged to
ask for an explanation of the mystery. The boy of the
house smiled and intimated that he was responsible for this<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
domestic miracle; later on, when dinner was over, he
removed the centre leaves from the table and displayed the
simple apparatus that he had constructed and which had
worked for several years without adjustment or repairs.</p>

<p>The illustration (<a href="#FigV14">Fig. 14</a>) represents the frame of a dining-table
with the middle cross-bar made fast to the side-rails,
so as to support the mechanism. At both ends, and inside
the rail, push-buttons are arranged and wires carried from
them to binding-posts close at hand, as may be seen at the
left side. The cross-bar at the middle of the table supports
a large spool on which the flexible cord is wound, and kept
taut by means of a clock-spring. This spool takes up the
slack between the ends of the table when it is lengthened
or shortened, while the smaller one opposite it keeps taut
the feed-wires that come up through the floor. A short
distance from the floor the wire is provided with a connector,
so that when the rug is removed the feed-wires may be disconnected
and slipped down.</p>

<p>The large spool can be had at any dry-goods store where
braids or fancy cords are kept. It should be about four
inches long, three inches in diameter, and with sides thick
enough to enable screws to be driven into it without fear of
splitting the wood. An old clock-spring is attached at one
side of the spool, while at the other two circular bands of
brass are made fast, one within the other. An axle of stout
wire should be driven through the spool; but if the hole is
too large, wooden plugs may be glued in at each end so that
a front view of the spool will appear as shown at A. The
metal bands are cut with shears from sheet-brass, and are
attached with fine steel nails, the heads of which are driven<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98-<br />99]<a id="Page99"></a></span>
in flush with the wood. A hole is made in the side of the
spool, close beside each band, so that the ends of wires may
be brought through them and attached to the bands. This
arrangement is illustrated at B, and at C the opposite end
is shown, with its clock-spring, one end of which is made
fast to the side of the spool and the other to the cross-rail.
A small round piece of wood is slipped over the axle, at the
spring side, and projects a quarter of an inch beyond the
spring. This is to keep the spring away from the arm that
stands out on that side to hold the spool in place.</p>

<div class="container m40" id="FigV14">

<div class="figcenter nomargin">

</div>

<p class="caption">A DINING-TABLE CALL</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>About half an inch of space is left between the spool and
the arm at the opposite side, so that the spring contact-strips
may be made fast to the arm and still have room to
act. A view looking down on the spool and springs is
shown at D, and E illustrates the arrangement of the circular
strips and the spring contact-strips. If the table is to
remain permanently in the same position, only one spool
will be required, for the floor wires can come up and connect
directly with the contact-strips. But if the table is to be
moved about, a tension-spool, independent of the push-button
wires, is necessary so that the position of the table
may be changed without unwinding the large spool and
dropping the cords down to the floor. The smaller spool
is made and mounted in the same manner, and should be
placed close to the large one. But a lighter spring will
operate it. One end of a double wire-cord is made fast to
binding-posts, mounted on a yoke of hard rubber or fibre,
so that the terminals will be kept apart, as shown at F.
The other ends are passed through the holes at one side of
the small spool and soldered fast to the circular strips, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
a small screw may be passed down through the hole, binding
the wire and touching the edge of one strip. Take care that
it does not touch the other strip. The cord is then wound
on the spool, and it is slipped in place so that the loose end
of the spring is caught and held over a nail or screw-head.
Turn the spool over several times to partially wind the
spring; then attach the terminals to the wires that come up
from the floor and the tension of the spring will draw the
wires taut. The two contact-strips of brass, that rest
against the brass circles, have insulated wires leading out
from them in order to connect them with the corresponding
wires leading from the strips of the larger spool.</p>

<p>A simple way to mount the spools is shown at A in <a href="#FigV15">Fig.
15</a>. A notch is cut in the face of the blocks large enough
to admit the axle; then a face-plate is screwed over the end
of the block to hold the axle in place. This arrangement
makes it easy to remove the spool, in case of necessity,
without detaching the arms from the cross-rail.</p>

<div class="container m40" id="FigV15">

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo100.jpg" alt="Spools" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Two sets of wires are wound on the large spool, one leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
to the right-hand and the other to the left-hand push-button
on the table-rails. The ends of the wires are arranged
so that one leading from both directions is made
fast to one circular strip on the spool, the other two being
attached to the remaining band. This is more clearly
shown at B in <a href="#FigV15">Fig. 15</a>, where the ends are visible as they
are twisted together and pass through their respective
holes. The spool is then turned over, and six or eight feet
of wire wound on from each side. The spring is coiled up
and caught on the nail or screw, and the ends of the wires
are made fast to the binding-posts near the push-buttons.
The wires from both push-buttons are then in connection
with the circular bands, which in turn are connected to the
bands on the smaller spool, and lead the current down
through the floor wires. By pushing the button at either
end the circuit is closed and the buzzer or bell is rung in the
kitchen or pantry.</p>

<p>Arranged in this manner, the wires are kept off the floor,
no matter where the table is moved, and it can be drawn
open as wide as may be found necessary to put in leaves.
When closed again, the spring causes the large spool to revolve
and wind up the wire.</p>

<h3>Chapter VI<br />
<span class="chaptitle">CURRENT-DETECTORS AND GALVANOMETERS</span></h3>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">A</span> current-detector is a necessary part of the
amateur electrician’s equipment; technically, this piece
of apparatus is called a galvanoscope.</p>

<p>When a wire or a number of them are brought near a
magnetic needle or a small compass, the needle will be
deflected from its north and south line and will point east
and west, or west and east, according to the direction in
which the current is passing through the wires. All wires
that are conducting electricity have a magnetic field, and
when brought near the magnetized needle of a compass
they have the power to act on it the same as another and
stronger magnet would.</p>

<p>The action of detectors depends upon two things&mdash;first,
the magnetized needle that, when properly balanced, will
point north and south; and, secondly, a current of electricity
passing through a wire or wires held above the needle, or
both above and below it. This is more clearly shown in
<a href="#FigVI1">Fig. 1</a>, where a compass is resting on a wire connected to
a battery. The wire also passes over the top of the compass,
which doubles the electro-magnetic field.</p>

<p>When the compass (with the needle pointing north) is<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
resting on the wire that is attached to the zinc pole of a
battery, and when the end of the wire that passes back
over the top of the compass is attached to the carbon pole,
the needle will fly around and point to the east. When the
wires are reversed, the needle will point to the west. Thus
the combination of a battery or other source of electric
current, a magnetic needle, and a coil of wire properly
arranged, make an instrument that will detect electric
currents and may be correctly called a current-detector.
The pressure of more or less current is determined by instruments
wound with wire of different sizes; the finer the
wire the more sensitive the instrument, and consequently
the more delicate. A very weak current can only be detected
with a delicate and sensitive instrument. The
coarser the wire and the larger the instrument, the better
it will be for testing strong currents that would perhaps
burn out the fine wire of the more delicate apparatus.</p>

<p>This instrument, when placed between a source of electricity
and a piece of apparatus, such as a bell, a motor, or
lamp, does not weaken the current, for it requires no waste
of electricity to operate the magnetic needle. Consequently,
when a very weak current is being used for any tests, it is
well to place a detector between the battery and the apparatus
to show that the current is actually passing through
the wire.</p>

<p>A simple detector is made by winding fifteen or twenty
feet of cotton-insulated copper wire No. 26 or 28 around
the lower end of a drinking-glass. Leave six inches of each
end loose; then after slipping the coil from the glass, tie
the wires with thread at least four times around the circle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
so as to bind the wires together. Press two sides of the
hoop together so as to flatten it; then with paraffine attach
the coil to a square block of wood, as shown in <a href="#FigVI2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>From a thin clock-spring, not more than three-eighths of
an inch wide, cut a piece two inches and a half long, and
with a stout pair of tin-shears cut the ends so as to point
them, as shown in <a href="#FigVI3">Fig. 3</a> A. With two pair of pliers bend a
hump at the middle of the strip on the dotted lines shown
in A, so that a side-view will appear like B in <a href="#FigVI3">Fig. 3</a>. Turn
this strip over on a hard-wood block or a piece of lead, and
with a stout steel-wire nail and a hammer dent the inverted<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
<span class="symbol">V</span> at the middle so that it will rest on the top of a needle-point
without falling off.</p>

<p>With three little pieces of wood make a bridge and attach
it to the wooden base over the paraffine that holds the wire-coil,
and drive a needle down in the middle of it, taking
care that it does not go through the back and touch the
wires underneath. On this needle hang the strip of steel
spring, and, if it does not properly balance, trim it with the
shears or a hard file until it is adjusted properly. Rub this
piece of steel over the pole ends of a large horseshoe magnet,
or place it within the helix of a large coil and turn a
powerful current through the coil. This will magnetize the
strip of steel, which will then become a magnetic needle and
hold the magnetism. Attach two binding-posts to corners
of the block, and make the loose ends of the coil-wires fast
to them. You now have a current-detector, or galvanoscope,
as shown in <a href="#FigVI4">Fig. 4</a>. Turn the block so that the needle
points to north and south and parallel to the strands of wire.</p>

<p>When the conductors from the poles of a battery or dynamo
are made fast to the binding-posts, the needle will
fly around to a position at right angles to that which it first
occupied, as shown by the dotted line A A in <a href="#FigVI4">Fig. 4</a>. When
the connection is broken the needle will turn around again
and point to north and south, since the magnetic field about
the wire ceases and disappears the instant the circuit is
broken.</p>

<p>This is one of the strange and unknown phenomena of
electricity, for while the current exerts a force that deflects
the needle, it does not destroy its magnetism. On the
breaking of the contact, no matter how long it may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
held the needle away from its true course, it again points to
north, and its magnetism is not affected.</p>

<p>Another simple current-detector is shown in <a href="#FigVI5">Fig. 5</a>. A
piece of broomstick is sawed in half and both pieces are
made fast to a block which is mounted on a base of wood
three-quarters of an inch in thickness. The vertical block
should measure five inches long, three inches high, and five-eighths
of an inch thick. The half-circular pieces of wood
are mounted so that the flat surfaces are three inches apart
and the lower edges are one inch above the base-block.
These may be held in place with glue and screws driven
through the back of the vertical block and into the ends
of the projecting half-circular pieces. The base-block is
six inches long and four inches wide, and the vertical block
is mounted on it one inch from an edge. The pieces of
broomstick are two inches long, and at the front ends a thin
bar of brass or copper is screwed fast to hold them apart
and in proper position, as shown at A in <a href="#FigVI5">Fig. 5</a>. To improve
the appearance of this mounting, all the wood-work may be
stained and shellacked before the metal parts are attached.</p>

<p>With No. 26, 28, or 30 cotton-insulated wire make from
fifteen to twenty wraps about the middle of the half-circular
pieces of wood and carry the ends down through small holes
in the base-block and thence through grooves cut at the
under side of the block to the front corners, where they are
to be made fast to binding-posts. A needle is to be set in
the base-block midway between the two pieces of half-circular
wood and through the strands of wire. Great care
must be taken that the needle does not touch any bare
wires, and as a precautionary measure it would be well to<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
wrap the needle with a piece of insulating-tape where it
passes through the strands of wire. Now place on the top
of it a magnetized piece of steel, as described for the detector
shown in <a href="#FigVI4">Fig. 4</a>. As it may not always be convenient
to turn the instrument so that the needle points north, a
small bar of magnetized steel or a stout needle that has been
magnetized with a horseshoe magnet or a helix, may be laid
across the half-circular wood pieces, so that it is parallel with
the top layer of wires&mdash;in fact, it should rest on top of them.</p>

<p>By means of this needle, or bar, the magnetic piece of
steel balanced on the vertical needle between the upper and
lower strands of insulated wire may be held in one position
no matter which way the block is turned. When the current
passes in through one binding-post and out through
the other (having thus travelled through the coil on the
half-circular blocks) the needle is deflected and points out
at the brass bar and back at the upright block.</p>

<p>When making any of these pieces of apparatus, where
delicately balanced magnetic needles are employed, all
parts of the mounting blocks or other sections must be put
together with glue and brass nails or screws. It will not do
to use steel or iron nails, screw-eyes, or washers, nor pieces
of sheet-iron, tin, or steel, for they will exert their influence
on the vital parts of the apparatus and so destroy their usefulness.
This is not so important when making buzzers,
bells, motor-induction coils, or similar things, but in delicate
instruments, where magnetic needles or electro-magnets are
used for recording, measuring, or detecting, iron and steel
parts should be carefully avoided, except where their use is
expressly indicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span></p>

<h4>An Astatic Current-detector</h4>

<p>Astatic current-detectors and galvanometers are those
having two magnetic needles arranged with the poles in
opposed directions.</p>

<p>The ordinary magnetic or compass needle points to the
North, and in order to deflect it a strong magnetic field must
be created near it. For strong electric currents the ordinary
single-needle current-detector meets all requirements, but
for weak currents it will be necessary to arrange a pair of
needles, one above the other, with their poles in opposite
directions, and placed within or near one or two coils of
fine wire. This apparatus will be affected by the weakest
of currents, and will indicate their presence unerringly.</p>

<p>The word “astatic” means having no magnetic directive
tendency. If the needles of this astatic pair are separated
and pivoted each will point to North and South, after the
ordinary fashion. For all astatic instruments we must
employ two magnetic needles in parallel, either side by side
or one above another, as shown in <a href="#FigVI6">Fig. 6</a>, with the N and S
poles arranged as indicated. This combination is usually
called Nobili’s pair. If both needles are of equal length
and magnetic strength, they will be astatic, for the power
of one counterbalances that of the other. As a consequent
neither points to North.</p>

<p>A compound needle of this form requires but a very
feeble current to turn it one way or the other, and this is
the theory upon which all astatic instruments are constructed.</p>

<p>A simple astatic current-detector may be made from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
single coil of fine insulated wire, a pair of magnetic needles,
and a support from which to suspend them, together with
a base-block.</p>

<p>For the base-block obtain a piece of white-wood, pine,
or cypress, four inches square and three-quarters of an
inch thick. Sand-paper it smooth, and then give it two
or three coats of shellac. From a strip of copper or brass
(do not use tin or iron) make a bridge, in the form of an
inverted <span class="symbol">V</span>, seven inches high, using metal one-sixteenth
of an inch thick and half an inch wide. This bridge is to
be screwed to the outside of the block, as shown at <a href="#FigVI7">Fig. 7</a>,
so that it will be rigid and firm. A small hole is drilled
through the top of the bridge to admit a screw-eye for the
tension.</p>

<p>Make a coil of No. 30 insulated wire, using ten or fifteen
feet, and wind it about the base of a drinking-glass to
shape it; then remove it and tie the coil, in several places,
with cotton or silk thread, so as to hold the strands together.
Shape it in the form of an ellipse and make it fast
to the middle of the base-board with small brass or copper
straps, and copper tacks or brass screws. Be very careful
not to use iron, steel, or tin about this instrument, as the
presence of these metals would deflect the needles and
make them useless.</p>

<p>Separate the strands at the top of the coil so that one
of the needles may be slipped through to occupy a position
in the middle of the coil. Ordinary large compass needles
may be employed for this apparatus, or magnetized pieces
of highly tempered steel piano-wire will answer just as
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span></p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A short piece of brass, copper, or wood will act as the
carrier-bar for the needles. These should be pushed through
holes made in the bar, and held in place with a drop of shellac
or melted paraffine. A small hole is drilled at the top
of the bar, or a small eye can be attached, through which
to pass the end of a thread. The upper end of the thread
is tied in a screw-eye, the screw part of which passes up
through the hole in the bridge and into a wooden button
or knob, which can be turned to shorten or lengthen the
thread, and so raise or lower the needles. The lower needle<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
must be pivoted at an equal distance between the upper
and lower parts of the coil.</p>

<p>Two binding-posts are arranged at the corners of the
base, and the ends of the coil wires are attached under the
screw-heads. The in-and-out wires are to be made fast
under the copper washers on the screw-eyes.</p>

<p>Owing to the astatic qualities of the needles, the base-block
does not have to be turned so that the coil may face
North and South, as in the current-detector. When the
slightest current of electricity passes through the coil it
instantly affects the needles, turning them to the right or
left according to the way in which the current is running
through the coil.</p>

<h4>An Astatic Galvanometer</h4>

<p>The sensitiveness of an astatic detector may be increased
by the added strength of the coil-field for a given current.</p>

<p>There are two ways of accomplishing this result. The
number of turns of wire may be increased in the coil, or
two coils may be used, placed side by side. The latter
method is the more satisfactory, since then the coil does
not have to be opened at the top to admit the lower needle,
the latter being dropped down between the coils. This apparatus
is shown in the illustration of an astatic galvanometer,
<a href="#FigVI8">Fig. 8</a>. The general arrangement of needles, bridge,
and coils, is the same as described for the astatic current-detector.</p>

<p>Each coil is made separately of ten feet of No. 30 insulated
copper wire, wound about the base of a drinking-glass to<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
shape it; then pressed into elliptical shape, and fastened
to a base-block with a brass or copper strip, and held down
with small brass screws.</p>

<p>The base-block should be four inches square, with the
corners sawed off. Smooth the block with sand-paper, and
then give it several good coats of shellac.</p>

<p>The bridge is made from brass one-sixteenth of an inch
thick and half an inch wide. The coils of wire are arranged
about half an inch apart, and at both ends a small separator-block
is placed between the coils, and then bound with silk
or cotton thread. A circular indicator disk of bristol-board
should be cut out and marked and attached to the top of
the coils with a few drops of sealing-wax or paraffine; then
the needles are suspended so as to hang properly, one above
the card, the other between the coils.</p>

<p>Three binding-posts are placed at one end of the block,
and to them the end wires of the coils are led and attached.
To the first binding-post (at the left) the strand of wire
leading to the first coil is attached. It leads in and is coiled
as the hands move on a clock, from left to right. The leading-out
wire from the coil is made fast to the middle post.
The leading-in wire to the second coil is also made fast to
the middle post. The coil wires should have the turns in
the same direction as the first coil; then the last wire is
attached to the right-hand post.</p>

<p>When making connections for a strong current, use an
end and middle post. This arrangement will operate but
one coil. For very weak currents make the leading in and
out wires fast to the end-posts. This latter plan is more
clearly shown in the diagram, <a href="#FigVI9">Fig. 9</a>. A and B represent<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
the coils, C, D, and E the binding-posts. The current,
entering at C, passes through the coil A (as the hands move
about the dial of a clock) and out at D, where connection is
made with the wire leading in to coil B. The current passes
through this coil in the same direction as the clock hands
move, and out to post E. Be careful to arrange the wiring
and connections after this exact manner, otherwise the instrument
will not be of any use.</p>

<p>The adjustment at the top of the bridge may be made
with an inverted screw-eye and a small cork into which the
eye can be screwed, thus raising or lowering the needles to
the proper position. Be sure to have the needles in parallel
when at rest.</p>

<p>As the needles and coils are very sensitive it would be
well to cover the instrument with an inverted glass jar.
A bluestone or gravity battery jar will answer very well,
and after the wires are connected to the binding-posts the
glass may be placed over the entire apparatus.</p>

<h4 id="Ref003">A Tangent Galvanometer</h4>

<p>For testing the various degrees of intensity of a current
a tangent galvanometer is usually employed. In this apparatus
the increased strength is indicated by the index-pointer
as it plays over a scale or graduated circle.</p>

<p>A simple tangent galvanometer may be made from a flat
hoop of wood-fibre or brass, mounted on a base by means
of two uprights, together with the necessary compass
needle, an index-card, insulated wire, and binding-posts
for the electrical connections. This piece of apparatus is<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
shown in <a href="#FigVI10">Fig. 10</a>. It is built on a base-block six by seven
inches and three-quarters of an inch thick. The block
should be of selected wood, and after it is made smooth it
should be given several coats of shellac.</p>

<p>Two upright pieces of wood, five inches long, half an inch
thick, and one inch in width, are screwed fast to the rear
edges of the base-block to support the hoop on which the
insulated wire is wound. Be careful not to use any iron or
steel in the construction of this or any other recording
instrument, except where it is expressly stated. Screws,
nails, staples, or any bits of anchoring wire should be of
copper or brass. String, thread, or silk may be used, especially
where coils of wire are to be bound or fastened to
hoops or base-blocks. The balance of the indicating needle
is so delicate, and the sensitiveness of the coils is so easily
affected, that nothing about or near the instruments should
be of iron or steel.</p>

<p>The hoop may be made of very thin hickory wood,
steamed and bent so as to form a ring six inches outside
diameter and one inch wide. It is even possible to construct
a satisfactory hoop from a ribbon of brown paper,
rolled and lapped, the several thicknesses being glued as
the turns are made.</p>

<p>If a metal hoop is to be used, solder the ends of a thin,
hard ribbon of brass, copper, or zinc. This strip should be
provided with holes, set in pairs about four inches apart,
all around the hoop, and where the hoop is to be attached
to the uprights two holes should be made close to the
margins through which brass screws may pass.</p>

<p>Across the middle of the hoop a strip of wood six inches<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
long, an inch wide, and a quarter of an inch thick is made
fast. On this the graduated card is placed, and at the
centre the balanced magnetic needle is arranged on a pivot.</p>

<p>After the cross-stick is in place, wind five turns of No. 24
insulated copper wire about the hoop, keeping it as nearly
in the centre as possible. One end of the wire (the beginning)
is to be attached to the first binding-post on the front
of the base, and the other end to the second post. The wire
should be wound round the hoop in the same direction as
the clock hands travel about a dial.</p>

<p>Another coil, composed of ten turns of wire, is made over
the first one, the beginning end being attached to the middle
binding-post and the last end to the third post. This
arrangement is shown in <a href="#FigVI11">Fig. 11</a>, D and E representing the
coils, while A, B, and C are the binding-posts. The current
enters at A, passes through coil D, and out at post B. The
next passage is in at B, through E, and out at C. A current
passing in at A will travel to B, thence through E, and out
at C. If the leading-in wire is made fast to A, and the out
wire to C, the current will travel through the entire coil.</p>

<p>Under this plan one or both coils may be used (the short
or long one as desired) by making connections with the first
and second binding-posts, the second and third, or the first
and third, as the strength of the current will warrant.</p>

<p>Strong currents will deflect the needle when travelling
through a short coil, but the weaker the current the more
coils it will have to pass through to properly deflect the
needle and indicating pointer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span></p>

<p>When the coils are all on, the hoop should be attached
to the uprights with small brass screws driven through holes
in the hoop and into the wood. The wire is bound to the
hoop by means of threads or silk passed through each pair
of holes in the hoop, and then tied fast. Fine insulated
wire may be used in place of the thread, but care should
be taken that the insulation is in perfect shape on both
the binding and coil wires; otherwise a short-circuit will
quickly destroy the value of the coils.</p>

<p>The hoop should not touch the base-block, but should
clear it by a quarter or half an inch. Make the coil ends
fast (as described for the astatic galvanometer and illustrated
at <a href="#FigVI9">Fig. 9</a>) by means of binding-posts. The wires need
not be carried over the top of the block, but may run through
holes under the hoop and along grooves cut in the under side
of the block and leading to the foot of the binding-posts.</p>

<p>The graduated card should be made from a piece of stout
bristol-board or heavy card-board having a smooth, hard
surface. It is laid out with a pencil or pen compass, as
shown at <a href="#FigVI12">Fig. 12</a>, and should be three inches in diameter.
The card is placed on the wood strip or ledge, so that the
zero marks will be at the front and rear, or at right angles
to the hoop and coils of wire. The compass needle, when
at rest, should lie parallel with the coils, so that the current
will deflect the needle and send the indicator around to one
side or the other of zero, according to the direction in which
the current is passing through the coils.</p>

<p>This is more clearly shown at <a href="#FigVI13">Fig. 13</a>. The circle represents
the outside diameter of the card; the dark cross-piece,
the magnetic needle; and the pointed indicator, a stiff
paper, or very thin brass or copper strip, cut and attached
to the needle with shellac or paraffine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span></p>

<p>When at rest the magnetic needle should be parallel to
the coils. To insure this the instrument must be moved
so that the lines of wire forming the coil will run North and
South. Otherwise the N-seeking end of the magnetic shaft
will point to North, irrespective of the position occupied by
the wire coil.</p>

<p>The magnetic needle may be made as described for the
compass (see <a href="#Page54">chapter iv.</a>, Magnets and Induction Coils).
It should be arranged to rest on a brass pivot pressed down
into the cross-piece of wood.</p>

<p>The indicator-needle may be cut from stiff paper, thin
sheet-fibre, or very thin cold-rolled brass or copper, the
latter being commonly known as hard or spring-brass.
Only one pointer is really necessary&mdash;that pointing to the
front. But the weight of the material would have a tendency
to upset the magnetic needle, and therefore it is better
to carry an equally long tail or end, on the opposite side, to
properly balance the needle.</p>

<p>A very weak current, passing in through the first post
and out at the third, will cause the indicator to be deflected
considerably, or so that it will point from 40° to 60° on
either side of the zero point, according to the direction in
which the current is running through the coils.</p>

<p>When not in use the magnetic needle should be removed
from the pivot, and placed in a box or other safe place,
where it will not become damaged.</p>

<p>A differently arranged tangent galvanometer is shown at
<a href="#FigVI14">Fig. 14</a>. As the line of binding-posts would indicate, there
are several coils of wire about the circle or hoop.</p>

<p>This galvanometer can be used for either strong or weak<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
currents, since it is wound with both coarse and fine insulated
wire. An upright plate of wood, seven inches wide
and eight inches high, supports the hoop and compass.
The top corners are sawed off, and four inches above the
bottom a straight cut is made across the plate, five inches
wide and arched in a half-circle five inches in diameter.
A shelf of wood a quarter of an inch thick, three inches
wide, and five inches long is made, and attached as a ledge
in this arched opening, so that a compass three inches in
diameter may rest upon it.</p>

<p>The shelf should be arranged so that it will hold the
compass in the middle of the circle instead of at one side.
The turns of wire will then be in line with the magnetic
needle when the latter is at rest. A base-block seven inches
long, three inches wide, and seven-eighths of an inch thick
is cut and attached to the upright plate by driving screws
through the bottom of the plate and into the rear edge of
the base. The corners are to be cut from the front of the
base, and ten small holes are to be bored half an inch out
from the upright and about a quarter of an inch apart.
These are for the end wires that will extend down from the
coils, and from thence to the binding-post holes. Grooves
may be cut in the under side of the base-block for the wires
to rest, in, as shown at <a href="#FigVI15">Fig. 15</a>, which is a view of the inverted
base.</p>

<p>A hoop is made of brass, six inches in diameter and an
inch wide. It is held to the upright plate with copper wire
passed through a small hole, bored at the inner edge of the
band, and back through two small holes bored in the plate,
the ends being twisted together at the back of the plate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
A wire at the top, bottom, and both sides will be sufficient
to hold it securely in place.</p>

<p>The first coil of wire is made of No. 18 insulated, and the
beginning end is made fast to the binding-post at the left.
The wire is carried up through the first hole under the hoop,
and after three turns have been made the end is carried
down through the second hole and made fast to the foot of
the second binding-post.</p>

<p>The second coil is of No. 24 insulated copper wire. The
beginning end is made fast to the second binding-post, carried
up through the third hole, given five turns about the
hoop, drawn down through the fourth hole, and attached
to the third binding-post.</p>

<p>The third coil is of the same size wire but has ten turns.
The fourth coil has twenty turns, and the fifth, of No. 30
insulated wire, has thirty turns, the last end being attached
to the post at the right. In all the coils there should be a
total of sixty-eight turns, or about one hundred and five
feet of wire.</p>

<p>For strong currents the in-and-out wires may be attached
to posts Nos. 1 and 2 at the left, and for weaker currents to
Nos. 2 and 3. For still weaker currents, use Nos. 3 and 4,
and so on. To detect the very weakest currents, attach
the in-and-out wires to the first and last post, and let the
current travel through all the coils or the entire length of
the wire wound about the hoop.</p>

<p>The magnetic needle is made in the same manner as
described for <a href="#FigVI10">Fig. 10</a>, and the pointer is attached in a similar
fashion. But instead of being mounted on a pivot
over a card, and so exposed to the open air and possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
draughts, the delicate mechanism is arranged within a brass
hoop, which is made fast to the ledge. The graduated card
is at the bottom of the hoop, or box formed by it, and to
protect the needle and prevent it from being displaced it
should be covered with glass. This can be done by making
a split ring of spring-brass wire and pressing it down inside
the hoop. Over this a round piece of glass is placed, and
another hoop is pressed in above it to hold the glass in
position. If the rings are carefully made and of stout wire
they will stay in place; otherwise a drop of melted sealing-wax
or paraffine will be necessary to keep them where they
are wanted.</p>

<p>The glass should be arranged close enough to the needle
to prevent it from jumping or being shaken off the supporting
pin, but not so close as to prevent its moving easily.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE</span></h3>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">he</span>
science of controlling forces is so well understood
and figured out that it becomes a simple mechanical
proposition to adapt the various types of controllers to any
form of power that may be employed. The tremendous
force stored within the mechanism of a great transatlantic
liner is governed by the twist of a man’s wrist. The
locomotive that will pull a hundred cars loaded with coal,
representing a weight of thousands of tons, is started and
stopped by a short lever that is drawn in one direction or
the other by a man’s hand. Great forces of all kinds are
quite as easily controlled as the supply of gas through a
jet&mdash;by simply turning the key that lets out so much as
may be required, no matter what the pressure is back of
the flow.</p>

<p>This same principle applies to electricity, but the means of
governing it is vastly different from the methods employed
for other forces. Electricity is an unknown and unseen
force, coming from apparently nowhere and returning to its
undiscovered country immediately upon the completion of
its work. The flow of steam, water, liquid air, gas, and
compressed air through pipes is governed by a throttle or<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
cock, which allows as much or as little to pass as may be
required; and if the joints, unions, and couplings in the pipes
are not absolutely tight there will be a leakage. Electricity
is controlled by resistance in its passage through solid wires,
rods, or bars, and cannot be confined within a given space
like water, nor held in tanks or pipes as a vapor or gas. It
is invisible, colorless, odorless, and occupies no apparent
space that can be measured; it is the most powerful and
terrible and yet docile force known to man, doing his bidding
at all times when properly governed and regulated. In
some respects, electricity can be compared to water stored
in a tank&mdash;for instance, if you have a tank of water containing
fifty gallons at an elevation of twenty-five feet, and a
pipe leading down from it, the pressure of the water at the
outlet of the pipe will be a given number of pounds. Now
if the tank were double the size the pressure at the outlet
of the pipe would be proportionately greater. Now if you
have a battery made up of a number of cells they will develop
a given number of volts, and if the number of the cells
be doubled the voltage will be correspondingly increased.
Or if you have a dynamo giving a certain number of volts,
that number may be increased by doubling the size.</p>

<p>The water contained within the tank represents its pressure
at the outlet of the pipe. The current in volts, generated
in a battery or dynamo, represents its pressure on an
outlet or conductor wire; and both represent the force behind
their respective conductors. The valve, or faucet, at
the end of the pipe plus the friction in the pipe would represent
the resistance to the flow of water, while the resistance-coils
or other mediums plus the size of the wire, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
conductor and switch, would regulate the flow of electric
current. The flow of water in a pipe under certain pressure
would represent its gallons per minute or hour, while with
electricity its flow in a wire or other conductor would represent
its amperage. It is to govern the flow of current
that resisting mediums are employed.</p>

<p>The resistance of electric current is measured in ohms, and
it is with this phase that we are interested in this chapter.
If there is only a small resistance put in the path of a current,
then it requires but a small pressure or voltage to send
it through the wires or circuit. This is easily understood
by the boy who has experimented with small incandescent
lamps in which short pieces of carbon-filament are contained.
It requires the pressure of a few volts only to send
the current through the carbon; but for the large carbon-filaments,
measuring ten or twelve inches in length, from
one hundred to five hundred volts may be necessary. The
ordinary house lamps require one hundred and ten volts
and half an ampere to give sixteen candle-power.</p>

<p>It is easily understood, then, that it requires a high pressure
or voltage to force the current through the resisting
carbon-filament, or across the space from one carbon to the
other in the arc-lamps used for street lighting. The shorter
and larger the conducting wires the less the resistance, and
consequently the lower the voltage or pressure necessary to
force it. Contrariwise the longer and finer the conducting
wares, the greater the resistance. As copper is the best
commercial conductor of electric currents, it is in universal
use, and in it the minimum of resistance is offered to the
current. Iron wire is a poorer conductor, and is not used<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
for high voltage (such as trolleys or transmission of power),
but is confined to telegraph and telephone lines and low-pressure
work. German-silver wire, one of the poorest
conductors, is not used for lines at all, but is employed
solely as a resisting medium for controlling current.</p>

<h4>Ohm’s Law</h4>

<p>This is the fundamental formula expressing the relations
between current, electro-motive force, and resistance in an
active electric circuit. It may be expressed in several ways
with the same result, as follows:</p>

<p>1. The current strength is equal to the E. M. F. (electro-motive
force) divided by the resistance.</p>

<p>2. The E. M. F. (electro-motive force) is equal to the
current strength multiplied by the resistance.</p>

<p>3. The resistance is equal to the E. M. F. (electro-motive
force) divided by the current strength.</p>

<p>All these are different forms of the same statement; and
when figuring electrical data, C stands for current, E for
electro-motive force, and R for resistance.</p>

<h4>Resistance-coils and Rheostats</h4>

<p>The method by which electricity is controlled is resistance.
No matter how great the voltage of a current, nor its volume
in amperes, it can be brought down from the deadly force
of the electric trolley-current to the mild degree needed to
run a small fan-motor, an electric bell, or a miniature lamp.
This is accomplished by means of resisting mediums, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span>
as fluids or wires, which hold back the current, and allow
only the small quantity to pass that may be required to
operate the apparatus.</p>

<p>The jump from the high voltage of the trolley-current to
the low one required for the electric bell, a lamp, or a small
motor, is frequently made in traction-work, but in this case
regular transformers are used. For the small apparatus,
that may have its current supplied from a battery, or a
small dynamo driven by a water-motor, the forms of resistance-coils
and rheostats described on the following pages
should meet every requirement.</p>

<p>The standard unit of resistance is called an ohm, so
named after Dr. G. S. Ohm, a German electrician, whose
theory on the subject is accepted as the basis on which to
calculate all electrical resistance. The legal ohm is the
resistance of a mercury column one square millimetre in
cross-sectional area and one hundred and six centimetres in
length, and at a temperature of 0° Centigrade or 32° Fahrenheit,
or the freezing-point for water. The conductivity of
metals is dependent greatly on their temperature, a hot wire
being a much better conductor than a cold one. Since
counter-electro-motive force sometimes gives a spurious resistance,
the ohmic resistance is the true standard by which
all current is gauged.</p>

<p>In technical mechanism and close readings the ohmic
resistance counts for a great deal, but in the simple apparatus
that a boy can make the German-silver resistance coils
and the liquid resistance will answer every purpose.</p>

<p>To give a clearer idea of the principle of the rheostats, a
short description of the mercurial column will first be presented.<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
During the early part of the last century wires were
not used as a resisting medium for electric currents. In their
place, glass tubes, filled with mercury sealed at one end and
corked at the other, were arranged in rows and supported in
a wooden rack.</p>

<div class="container m40" id="FigVII1">

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo130.jpg" alt="Rheostat" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Wires led out from the top and bottom of each tube,
and were brought down to metal buttons arranged in a row
along the front edge of the base-plate, as shown in the illustration
of a mercurial rheostat (<a href="#FigVII1">Fig. 1</a>). Each tube represented
a certain resistance&mdash;one or more ohms, as required.
The outlet wire was attached to the button at one end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
row, and the inlet could be moved along from button to
button, until the required amount of current was obtained.</p>

<p>The mercurial rheostat was an expensive, cumbersome,
and treacherous thing to handle; it was liable to break, and
its weight often prohibited its use in places where the more
convenient and easily handled German-silver rheostats are
now in universal employment. Overheating the mercury in
the columns caused it to expand, and sometimes, before the
switch could be thrown open, an end would be forced out
and the mercury would climb over the edge of the glass
columns.</p>

<p>All metals have a certain amount of resistance for electric
currents, and some have more than others. German-silver,
for instance&mdash;a metal made of a mixture of other metals with
about eighteen per cent. of nickel (see <a href="#Page359">Appendix</a>)&mdash;is considered
to be the best commercial resistance medium, while
pure copper is regarded as the best commercial conductor.
Unalloyed copper is universally employed for electric conductors
of high voltage; but for telegraph and telephone
work, galvanized iron wire is still used extensively.</p>

<p>The finer the wire, the higher is its resistance, and the more
resistant the metal, the greater are the number of ohms to a
given length. To nine feet and nine inches of No. 30 copper
wire there is one ohm resistance, while to No. 24&mdash;which is
six sizes coarser&mdash;there is one ohm to thirty-nine feet and
one inch. In many cases it is necessary to use the coarser
wire and greater length, as the current would superheat or
burn the fine wire, while the coarser would conduct it safely.</p>

<p>For very high voltage and amperage&mdash;such as used in traction
cars, in power stations, and in manufacturing plants&mdash;castings<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
of German-silver are employed and linked in series.
They are more easily handled than the coils of wire, and a
greater number of them can be accommodated in a small
space.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>For light currents in experimental work, where batteries
are employed, obtain a pound or two of bare German-silver
wire, from Nos. 24 to 30, and wind the strands on a round
piece of stick attached to a winder (see Magnets and Induction-Coils,
<a href="#Page54">chapter iv.</a>). Make several of these coils,
two or three inches long, with the wire wound closely and
evenly. When pulled apart the coils will appear as shown
in <a href="#FigVII2">Fig. 2</a> A, and will resemble a spiral spring. This can
be made fast over a porcelain knob and the ends caught
down, as shown at B in <a href="#FigVII2">Fig. 2</a>, or it may be drawn over a<span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span>
round stick, a porcelain tube, or a lug made of plaster of
Paris and dextrine (three parts of the former to one of the
latter), as shown at C in <a href="#FigVII2">Fig. 2</a>, and the ends securely bound
with a strand or two of wire, twisted tight to keep the ends
from slipping.</p>

<p>The lugs may be made in a mold, using as a pattern a
piece of broom-handle&mdash;shellacked and oiled to prevent the
plaster from adhering to it. Obtain a small square and
deep box, and drop some of the wet mixture down in the
bottom; on this place the broomstick, small end down (it
should be slightly tapered), and around it pour in the wet
plaster mixture. While it is setting, turn the stick with the
thumb and fingers, so as to shape the hole perfectly then
draw it out, and a true mold will be the result. When dry
enough, pour some shellac down into the mold and revolve
it, so that the shellac will be evenly distributed, and
let it harden for a day. Then saw off the end of the mold,
so that it will be open at both ends.</p>

<p>In order to make the lugs, pour in the plaster mixture,
taking care to oil the mold before each pouring, so that
the lug can be drawn out when the mixture has set. If it
sticks, tap the small end gently to start it. For coils where
there is little or no heat, ordinary pieces of broom-handle,
or round sticks having a coat or two of shellac, will answer
very well; but where the current heats the core, it must be
of some material that will not char.</p>

<p>Another method of making resistance-coils is to measure
off a length of wire; then double it, and with a small staple
attach the loop end at one end of the (wooden) core. Pay
out the two strands of wire an equal distance apart with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
thumb and fingers, and with the other hand twist the core.
At the other end of the spool catch the loose ends of the
wire under small staples, taking great care not to let the
staples touch or even be driven close together. This arrangement
is shown at D in <a href="#FigVII2">Fig. 2</a>, and for a field resistance-board
any number of these coils may be made.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FigVII3">Fig. 3</a> the mode of connecting coils is shown. The
dots represent contact-points to which the movable arm can
be shifted. The wires at the bottom of coil, Nos. 1 and 2,
are connected together, while those at the top of No. 2 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
3 are joined, and so on to the end. The leading-in current
is connected at pole H and so on to J, while the leading-out
wire is made fast to pole I. The switch-arm is moved
on the first dot, or contact-point, and the current passes up
wire A, down coil No. 1, up coil No. 2, down No. 3, up No.
4, and so on to No. 6, and down wire G and out at I. Supposing
that this offers too much resistance, the switch-arm
is moved up one point. This cuts out coil No. 1, as the
current passes up wire B, through coil No. 2, down No. 3,
and so on, and out through G and pole I. Another move
of the switch and coil No. 2 is cut out, the current passing
up wire C, down coil No. 3, up No. 4, and so on, and out at
I. Each move of the switch cuts out one coil, lessening the
resistance; but when moved to the last contact-point the
current flows without resistance&mdash;in at H, through the
switch-arm, and out at I.</p>

<p>The plan of arranging the coils suggested at <a href="#FigVII2">Fig. 2</a> B is
shown in <a href="#FigVII4">Fig. 4</a>, where four of the coils are arranged in series
over porcelain knobs, and the lower ends made fast to the
base-board with small staples. Small pieces of brass are
used for the switch contact-plates; those are provided with
one plain and one countersunk hole for a flat and round
headed screw.</p>

<p>The screw-heads are arranged in a semicircular fashion,
so that the switch-arm, attached at one end to the screw J,
will touch each plate as it is moved forward or backward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span></p>

<p>The current passing in at binding-post A travels to J and
B, the latter being the resting-plate for the switch-arm.
A move of the arm to C sends the current up over the first
coil and down; then over the second, third, and fourth
coils, and out at G; through plate H (which is the rest at the
right side), and out at I.</p>

<p>A move of the switch-arm to D cuts out the first coil; a
move to E, the first and second coils; and so on until the
last plate is reached, when the current will pass without resistance
in at A, through J, and out at I.</p>

<p>A simple arrangement for a resistance-coil is shown in
<a href="#FigVII5">Fig. 5</a>. This consists of a set of small metal plates in which
two holes are made, one for a screw, the other for a screw-eye
(see <a href="#Ref004">Binding-posts</a>, <a href="#Page33">chapter iii.</a>). Two lines of steel-wire
nails are driven along a board, and German-silver wire
is drawn around them in zig-zag fashion, beginning at the
left and going towards the right side of the board. One end
of wire is made fast under the screw-head on plate A. The
strand is carried out around the first nail on the lower row
and over the first one on the upper row, then down, up, down
until six nails have been turned. The wire is then carried
down to the screw in plate B, given two turns, and carried
up again and over the nail on the top row, repeating the
direction of zigzag No. 1, until six of them are made. The
end of the wire is then made fast to plate G, and all the
screws are driven in to hold the plates and wire securely.</p>

<p>The inlet wire is attached to A, the outlet to G, and any
degree of resistance can be had by moving the inlet wire to
the various plates along the line, cutting out sections Nos. 1
to 6 as desired.</p>

<p>For heavier wire the arrangement as shown in <a href="#FigVII6">Fig. 6</a>
should be satisfactory.</p>

<p>A frame twelve by fifteen inches is constructed of wood
three-quarters of an inch thick and one inch and a quarter
wide, having the ends securely fastened with glue and
screws. Spirals are wound of German-silver wire (any size
from No. 16 to 22), and drawn apart. The ends are caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span>
to the frame with small staples, and each alternate coil-end
is joined, as shown in <a href="#FigVII6">Fig. 6</a>. The leading-out wires to the
contact-points on the switch should be of insulated copper,
and are to run down the sides of the frame, and so to the
switch-board. To clearly illustrate, however, the plan of
wiring, the drawing is made so as to show the leads from
the coil-ends to the switch. Care should be taken to study
this drawing well, so as not to make an error in connecting
a wrong end to a contact-point, thereby causing a short
circuit. When properly connected the current passes in at
A and out at I; but if wires are improperly connected, the
current will jump when the switch-arm reaches the misconnected
contact.</p>

<p>The switch is an important part of every rheostat, and
should be carefully and accurately made. One of the
simplest and most practical switches is constructed from a
short, flat bar of brass or copper having a knob attached at
one end and a hole provided at the other through which a
screw may pass (see <a href="#Ref005">Switches</a>, <a href="#Page33">chapter iii.</a>). The contact-points
are made from one or two copper washers, with the
holes countersunk so that a machine screw of brass, with a
flat head, will fit the hole snugly. The top of the head
will then be flush with the top of the washer, as shown at
<a href="#FigVII7">Fig. 7</a> A. The bolt is passed down through a piece of board,
then slate or soapstone, and caught with a washer and nut,
as shown at <a href="#FigVII7">Fig. 7</a> B. A loop of wire is passed about the
bolt end, then another nut is screwed tightly over it to hold
it in place, as well as to lock the first nut. The binding-posts
that hold the inlet and outlet wires may be made of
bolts and nuts also, as shown at <a href="#FigVII7">Fig. 7</a> B;
but the bolt must<span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span>
be passed through the switchboard so that the head is at
the rear and the ends project out to receive the nuts.</p>

<p>A very compact and simple rheostat and switch is shown
in <a href="#FigVII8">Fig. 8</a>. It is composed of a base-board, eight blocks of
hard-wood, and a top strip used as a binder to lock the upper
ends of the blocks together. The hard-wood blocks are
three-quarters of an inch thick, one inch and a half wide, and
four inches long. A small hole is made near each end of
the block and through one of them an end of the wire is
passed. The wire is then wound round the block, taking
care to lay it on evenly, and with about one-eighth of an
inch of space between each strand. When the opposite
hole is reached, pass the end of the wire through it and clip
it. The block will then resemble <a href="#FigVII7">Fig. 7</a> C. There should
be three or four inches of wire at each end for convenience in
connection, and when the eight blocks are wound they are
to be mounted on end at the rear side of a base-board measuring
ten inches long, three inches wide at the ends, and
nine at the middle (or across the face of the switchboard
to the rear edge behind the blocks). Use slim steel-wire
nails and glue to attach the blocks to the base; or slender
screws may be employed. Across the top lay a piece of
wood a quarter of an inch in thickness, and drive small nails
or screws down through it and into the blocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span></p>

<p>Connect the ends of the coils together in series, as already
described, and carry the wires under the base-plate in
grooves cut with a <span class="symbol">V</span>-shaped chisel. If the sunken wires
are bothersome, the work may be avoided by running the
wires direct to the foot of the contact-points and elevating
the rheostat on four small blocks that may be screwed, or
nailed and glued, under the corners, as shown in <a href="#FigVII8">Fig. 8</a>.
These will raise the base half an inch or more above the
table on which the rheostat will rest so as to allow room for
the under wires.</p>

<p>A rheostat of round blocks standing on end is shown at
<a href="#FigVII9">Fig. 9</a> A. These are pieces of curtain-pole, four inches long
and wound with loops of No. 16 or 18 wire, as shown at
<a href="#FigVII9">Fig. 9</a> B. The loop and loose ends are caught with staples,
and when arranged on a base-board they are to be connected
in series as before described. One long, slim screw
passed up through the base-board and into the lower end
of the block will hold each block securely in place. To
keep it from twisting, a little glue may be placed under the
blocks so that when the screw draws the block down to the
base it will stay there permanently upon the hardening of
the glue. The leading wires should be slipped under the
washers forming the contact-points of the switch; or they
may be carried under the board to the nuts that hold the
lower ends of the bolts.</p>

<p>Another form of rheostat (<a href="#FigVII10">Fig. 10</a> A) is made by sawing
a one-inch curtain-pole into four-inch lengths and cross-cutting
each piece with eight or ten notches, as shown at
<a href="#FigVII10">Fig. 10</a> B. These pieces are screwed and glued fast along
each side of a base-board eight inches wide and fourteen
inches long, so that the notches face the outer edges of the
board. The strand of wire passes round these upright blocks
and fits into the notches so as to prevent them from falling
down.</p>

<p>The top end of wire at each pair of blocks is made fast by
a turn or two of another piece of wire and a twist to hold it<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>
securely; then the loose end is carried down through a hole
and along under the board to the foot of a contact-point.</p>

<p>Any number of these upright coils may be made, and on a
long board the switch may be arranged at one side instead
of at the end, as shown in <a href="#FigVII10">Fig. 10</a> A. When making ten or
more coils it is best to use three or four sizes of wire, beginning
with fine and ending with coarse. For instance, in a
twelve-coil rheostat make three coils of No. 26, three of No.
22, and three of No. 18; or if coarser wire is required use
Nos. 20, 16, and 12.</p>

<p>German-silver comes bare and insulated. It is preferable
to have the fine wire insulated, but the heavier sizes may be
bare, as it is cheaper; moreover, if heated too much the insulation
will burn or char off. When cutting out the coils
always begin at the end where the finer wire is wound;
then as the current is admitted more freely the heavier wires
will conduct it without becoming overheated.</p>

<p>For running a sewing-machine, fan, or other small direct-current
motor wound for low voltage, the house current (if
electric lights are used in the house) may be brought down
to the required voltage with German-silver rheostats similar
to these already described. Another and very simple
method is to arrange sixteen-candle-power lamps in series,
as shown in <a href="#FigVII11">Fig. 11</a>. Six porcelain lamp-sockets are screwed
fast to a wood base and the leading in and out wires
brought to binding-posts or the contact-points of a switch.
The leading-in wire to the series is made fast at binding-post
A, which in turn is connected with screw B, under the head
of which the switch-arm is held. When the switch is thrown
over to contact-point C the current passes through lamp<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
No. 1 back to point D; through lamp No. 2 back to E; then
through lamps Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6, and out through point I
to post J. A turn of the switch to D cuts out lamp No. 1, to
E cuts out No. 2, and so on. The filaments of incandescent
lamps in their vacuum are among the very best mediums of
resistance, and with a short series of lamps a current of
220 volts can quickly be cut down to a few volts for light
experimental work or to run some small piece of apparatus.</p>

<p>Lamps in series are often used to cut down the current for
operating electric toys and trains. The adjustment of the
current should never be left to children, however, but should
be attended to by some one qualified to look after the
apparatus. Otherwise an unpleasant or even dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
shock may be received. Another simple form of resistance
apparatus is made from the carbon pencils used for arc
lights. Short pieces will answer very well, but if the long
bare ones can be had they will be found preferable. Do not
use the copper-plated ones as they would conduct the current
too freely; they should be bare and black. Now around
the ends of each piece take several turns of copper wire for
the terminals and cut-out wires. Fasten those pencils down
on a board (as shown at <a href="#FigVII12">Fig. 12</a>) by boring small holes
through the board, passing a loop of copper wire down
through the holes, and giving the ends a twist underneath.
The leading wires to and from the contact-points should be
insulated and may be above or below the board. From the
descriptions already given, the connections of this rheostat
can readily be understood.</p>

<p>The rheostat shown in <a href="#FigVII13">Fig. 13</a> is perhaps the most complete
and practical apparatus that a boy could make or
would need. It is composed of a frame, six porcelain tubes,
a switchboard, and the necessary German-silver and copper
wire.</p>

<p>From an electrical supply-house obtain six porcelain tubes
fourteen by three-quarter inch. Porcelain tubes and rods
warp in the firing and are seldom straight; in purchasing
these select them as nearly perfect as possible in shape, size,
and length.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span></p>

<p>Buy, also, twelve small porcelain knobs that are the right
size to fit inside the large tubes. These should have holes
bored through them to admit screws. Construct a frame
of hard-wood to accommodate the tubes, as shown in the
drawing, and leave one end loose. With slim screws make
the porcelain knobs fast to the top and bottom strips of the
frame, as shown in <a href="#FigVII14">Fig. 14</a>. The porcelain rods will fit over
these and will thus be held securely in the frame, one small
knob entering the tube at each end, as indicated by the
dotted lines in <a href="#FigVII14">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

<p>The first porcelain tube to the left is wound with No. 22
German-silver wire, the next with No. 20, the third with
No. 18, then Nos. 16, 14, and 12; so that in this field a broad
range can be had for a current of 110 volts.</p>

<p>The coils are connected in series, as explained for the other
rheostats, and the leading wires brought down to the back
of a switchboard of which <a href="#FigVII13">Fig. 13</a> A is the front and <a href="#FigVII13">Fig. 13</a>
B the rear view. The switchboard is made of thin slate or
soapstone; or a fibre-board may be employed. Fibre-board
is especially made for electrical work, and can be had from
a large supply-house in pieces of various thickness, three-eighths
of an inch being about right for this board. Brass
bolts and nuts and copper washers are used for the contact-poles,
and when the ends of the leading wires are looped
around the bolts the nuts are to be screwed down tightly so
as to make good contacts. This rheostat may be used when
lying on a table, or it can be hung up by means of two
screw-eyes driven in the top of the frame, as shown in
<a href="#FigVII13">Fig. 13</a> A.</p>

<p>A convenient form of rheostat for fine wire and high
resistance is shown in <a href="#FigVII15">Fig. 15</a>. This is on the plan of the
well-known Wheatstone rheostat and does not require a
switchboard nor a series of coils. Two rollers, one of wood
the other of metal or brass-covered wood, are set in a frame,
and by means of a handle and projecting ends with square<span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span>
shoulders, one or the other of the rollers may be turned so
that the wire on one winds up while on the other it unwinds.</p>

<p>The wooden roller may be made from a piece of curtain-rod
one inch in diameter, and it should have a thread cut
on it. This will have to be done on a screw-cutting lathe,
and any machinist will do it for a few cents. There should
be from twelve to sixteen threads to the inch&mdash;no more&mdash;although
there may be as few as eight. Twelve will be
found a good number, as that does not crowd the coils and
the risk of their touching is minimized. The ends of the
roller should have bearings that will fit in holes made in the
end-pieces of the frame, and at one end of each roller a
square shoulder is to be cut, as shown at A in <a href="#FigVII16">Fig. 16</a>. A
short handle may be made from two small pieces of wood,
as shown at B in <a href="#FigVII16">Fig. 16</a>. It must be provided with a square
hole so that it will fit on the roller ends. The metal roller
may be made from a piece of light brass tubing one inch in
diameter through which a wooden core is slipped; or it can
be a piece of brass-covered curtain-pole with the ends shaped
the same as the wooden one. The wood roller should have
a collar of thin brass or copper (or other soft metal except
lead) attached to the front end; or several turns of wire may
be made about the roller so as to form a contact-point. A
piece of spring brass, copper, or tin rests on this collar and
is held fast under a binding-post, which in turn is screwed
to the wooden frame. A similar strip of spring metal is
held under another post on the opposite side of the frame
and bears on the metal roller.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>German-silver wire is wound on the wooden roller, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
end having been made fast to the metal collar; and when all
the thread grooves on the wood roller are filled the opposite
end of the wire is attached to the rear end of the metal roller.
The current entering at binding-post No. 1 crosses on the
strip of spring metal to the collar, travels along the coil of
wire, and crosses to the metal roller and is conducted out
at binding-post No. 2 (see <a href="#FigVII15">Fig. 15</a>). If the resistance is too
great slip the handle over the end of the metal roller and
give it several turns. The current will then pass with
greater freedom as the wire on the wooden roller becomes
shorter. This may be readily seen by connecting a small
lamp in series with a battery and this rheostat. As the<span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span>
metal cylinder is turned the current flows more freely and
the filament becomes red, then white, and finally burns to
its full capacity. Take care, however, not to admit too
much current as it will burn out the lamp. Some sort of
adjustment should be made to prevent the rollers turning
of themselves and thus allowing the wire coils to slacken.
This may be done by boring the two holes for the rollers to
fit in and then, with a key-hole saw, cutting the stick as
shown at C in <a href="#FigVII16">Fig. 16</a>, taking care not to split it at the ends.
The result will be a long slot which, however, has nothing to
do with the bearings. Down through the middle of the
stick make a hole with an awl, so that the screw-eye will
move easily in the upper half but will hold in the lower
half. Under the head of the eye place a small copper washer;
then with the thumb and finger drive the screw-eye down
until the head rests on the washer.</p>

<p>A slight turn of the eye when it is in the right place will
draw the upper and lower parts of the stick together and
bind the wood about the bearing ends of the rollers. The
rollers should not be held too tightly as that would strain
the wire when winding it from one to the other. It should
be just tight enough to keep the wire taut.</p>

<p>Two or more of these roller resistance-frames may be
made and connected in series so that a close adjustment can
be had when using battery currents for experimenting.</p>

<h4>Liquid Resistance</h4>

<p>Apart from metallic, mercurial, or carbon resistance a
form of liquid apparatus is frequently used in laboratory
and light experimental work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span></p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>This style of resistance equipment is the least expensive
to make, and will give excellent satisfaction to the boy who
is using light currents for induction-coils, lamps, galvanometers,
and testing in general. The simplest form of liquid
resistance is made by using a glass bottle with the upper
part cut away. The cutting may be done with a steel-wheel
glass-cutter. The bottle should then be tapped on
the cut line until the top part falls away. Go over the sharp
edges with an old file to chafe the edge and round it; then
solder a tin, copper, or brass disk to a piece of well-insulated
wire and drop it down in the bottom of the receptacle, as
shown at <a href="#FigVII17">Fig. 17</a>. Cut a smaller disk of metal, or use a
brass button, and suspend it on a copper wire which passes
through a small hole in a piece of wood at the top of the jar.
Notches should be cut at the under side of this wood cross-piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
so that it will fit on top of the jar and stay in place.
The jar is to be nearly filled with water, having a teaspoonful
of sulphate of copper dissolved in it. This will turn the
water a bluish color and make it a slightly better conductor,
particularly when the button is lowered close to the round
disk. If a high resistance is desired the copper may be
omitted leaving the water in its pure state. The wires leading
in and out of the jar should be connected between the
apparatus and the battery so that the proper amperage can
be had by raising or lowering the button. A series of these
liquid resistance-jars may be made of glass tubes an inch in
diameter and twelve inches long. One end of them may
be stopped with a cement made of plaster of Paris six parts,
ground silex or fine white sand two parts, and dextrine two
parts. Mix the ingredients together when dry, taking care
to break all small lumps in the dextrine; then add water
until it is of a thick consistency like soft putty. Solder the
ends of some copper wires to disks of copper or brass and set
them on the middle of bone-buttons; these in turn are to be
imbedded in the mixture after the wire has been passed
through a hole in the bottom.</p>

<p>Their location can be seen in the bottom of the tubes
<a href="#FigVII18">Fig. 18</a>, and <a href="#FigVII19">Fig. 19</a> A is an enlarged figure drawing of the
plate, button, and wire. The wires are brought out under
the lower edge of the tubes, and enough of the composition
is floated about the bottom and outer edge of the tube to
form a base, as shown in the drawing. A base-board is
made six inches wide and long enough to accommodate the
desired number of tubes. Two pieces of wood one inch
wide and three-quarters of an inch thick have hollow notches<span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span>
cut from them at one side, as shown at <a href="#FigVII19">Fig. 19</a> B. In these
notches the tubes are gripped. Screws are passed through
one stick and into the other so as to clamp the wood and
tubes securely together. The rear stick is supported on
two uprights which are made fast to the rear edge of the
base-plate with screws and glue.</p>

<p>Along the front of the base-board small metal contact
plates, or binding-posts, are arranged (see <a href="#Ref004">Binding-posts</a>,
<a href="#Page33">chapter iii.</a>) and the wires led to them from the tubes, as
shown in the drawing. The top or drop wires in the tubes
are provided with metal buttons at the ends; or the end of
the wire may be rolled up so as to form a little knob. The
manner of connecting the wires was freely explained in the
resistance-coil descriptions and may be studied out by
examining the drawing closely. In this resistance-apparatus
there are two ways of cutting out a medium&mdash;first, by lowering
the wire in the tube so that both contact-points meet; and
second, by cutting out the first tube altogether by connecting
the incoming wire with the second binding-post. Then
again the resistance may be regulated quite accurately by
raising or lowering the wires in the liquid.</p>

<p>For example, there is too much resistance if the current
has to travel through all the tubes. If it is too strong when
one tube is cut out, the wire in tube No. 1 is lowered so that
the contacts are an inch apart. Then the more accurate
adjustment is made by dropping the wire in the second tube,
as shown in <a href="#FigVII18">Fig. 18</a>. The wires leading out at the top of the
tubes are pinched over the edge to hold them in place. They
should be cotton insulated and the part that is in the liquid
should be coated with hot paraffine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page154">[154]</span></p>

<p>The water may be made a slightly better conductor if a
small portion of sulphate of zinc, or sulphate of copper, is
added to each tubeful.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Hittorf’s resistance-tube is one of the oldest on these lines,
and two or more of them are coupled in series, as described<span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span>
for this water-tube resistance; glass tubes are employed that
have one end sealed with a permanent composition, as described
for <a href="#FigVII18">Fig. 18</a>. A metallic cadmium electrode is placed
at the bottom of the tube, and the tube is then filled with
a solution of cadmium iodide one part and amylic alcohol
nine parts, and then corked. A wire passing down through
or at the side of the cork is attached to another small piece
of metallic cadmium, which touches the top of or is suspended
a short distance in the liquid.</p>

<p>As the alcohol is volatile the cork cannot be left out of the
tube, and the wire must be drawn through the cork with a
needle so that no opening is left for evaporation. A number
of these tubes may be made and coupled in series and the
wires led down to the contact-points of a switch.</p>

<h3>Chapter VIII<br />
<span class="chaptitle">THE TELEPHONE</span></h3>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">F</span><span class="afterlargecap">or</span>
direct communication over short or moderately
long distances, nothing has been invented as yet that
will take the place of the telephone. A few years ago, when
this instrument was first brought out, it was the wonder of
the times, just as wireless telegraphy is to-day. Starting
with the simple form of the two cups with membranes across
the ends, and a string or a wire connecting them, we have
to-day the complex and wonderful electric telephone, giving
perfect service up to a distance of two thousand miles.
Some day inventors in the science of telephony will make it
possible to communicate across or under the oceans, and
when the boys of to-day grow to manhood they should be
able to transact business by ’phone from San Francisco to
the Far East, or from the cities near the Atlantic coast to
London, Paris, or Berlin.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to enter into the history of telephones,
as this information may be readily found in any
modern encyclopædia or reference work. But the boy who
is interested in electricity wants to know how to make a
telephone, and how to do it in the up-to-date way, with the
wire and ground lines, switches, cut-outs, bell connections,<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
and other vital parts, properly constructed and assembled.
In this laudable ambition we will endeavor to help him.</p>

<p>The general principle of the telephone may be explained
in the statement that it is an apparatus for the conveyance
of the human voice, or indeed any sounds which are the
direct result of vibration.</p>

<p>Sound is due to the vibrations of matter. A piano string
produces sound because of its vibration when struck, or
pulled to one side and then released. This vibration sets
the air in rapid motion, and the result is the recording of
the sound on our ear-drums, the latter corresponding to the
film of sheepskin or bladder drawn over the hollow cup or
cylinder of a toy telephone. When the head of a drum is
struck with a small stick it vibrates. In this case the
vibrations are set in motion by the blow, while in the telephone
a similar phenomenon is the result of vibratory waves
falling from the voice on the thin membrane, or disk of
metal, in the transmitter. When these vibrations reach the
ear-drum the nervous system, corresponding to electricity
in the mechanical telephone, carries this sound to our brains,
where it is recorded and understood. In the telephone the
wire, charged with electricity, carries the sound from one
place to another, through the agencies of magnetism and
vibration.</p>

<p>Over short distances, however, magnetism and electricity
need not be employed for the transmission of sound. A
short-line telephone may be built on purely vibratory principles.
Almost every boy has made a “phone” with two
tomato-cans over which a membrane is drawn at one end
and tied. The middle of the membrane is punctured, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span>
a button, or other small, flat object, is arranged in connection
with the wires that lead from can to can.</p>

<h4>A Bladder Telephone</h4>

<p>A really practical talking apparatus of this simple nature
may be made from two fresh beef bladders obtained from
a slaughter-house or from the butcher. You will also need
two boards with holes cut in them, two buttons, some tacks,
and a length of fine, hard, brass, copper, or tinned iron wire.
The size should be No. 22 or No. 24. The boards should
be ten by fourteen inches and half an inch in thickness.
Cut holes in them eight inches in diameter, having first
struck a circle with a compass. This may be done with a
keyhole saw and the edges sand-papered to remove rough
places. Prepare the bladders by blowing them up and tieing
them. Leave them inflated for a day or two until they
have stretched, but do not let them get hard or dry.</p>

<p>When the bladders are ready, cut off the necks, and also
remove about one-third of the material, measuring from
end to end. Soak the bladders in warm water until they
become soft and white. Stretch them, loosely but evenly,
over the opening in the boards, letting the inside of the
bladder be on top, and tack them temporarily all around,
one inch from the edge of the opening. Test for evenness
by pushing down the bladder at the middle. If it stretches
smoothly and without wrinkles it will do; otherwise the
position and tacks must be changed until it sets perfectly
smooth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span></p>

<a id="FigVIII4"></a>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo159.jpg" alt="Bladder telephones" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The bladder must now be permanently fastened to the
board by means of a leather band half an inch wide and
tacks driven closely, as shown in <a href="#FigVIII1">Fig. 1</a>. With a sharp
knife trim away the rough edges of the bladder that extend
beyond the circle of leather. Attach a piece of the fine wire
to a button, as shown in <a href="#FigVIII2">Fig. 2</a>, and pass the free end
through the centre of the bladder until the button rests on<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
its surface. Then fasten an eight-pound weight to the end
of the wire and set in the sun for a few hours, until thoroughly
dry, as shown at <a href="#FigVIII3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p>When both drums are complete, place one at each end
of a line, and connect the short wires with the long wire,
drawing the latter quite taut. The course of the main wire
should be as straight as possible, and should it be too long
it may be supported by string loops fastened to the limbs of
trees, or suspended from the cross-piece of supports made
in the form of a gallows-tree or letter F. To communicate
it will be necessary to tap on the button with a lead-pencil
or small hard-wood stick. The vibration will be heard at
the other end of the line and will attract attention.</p>

<p>By speaking close to the bladder in a clear, distinct tone,
the sound will carry for at least a quarter of a mile, and the
return vibrations of the voice at the other end of the line
can be clearly recognized.</p>

<h4>A Single (Receiver) Line</h4>

<p>The principal parts of the modern telephone apparatus
are the transmitter, receiver, induction-coil, signal-bell, push-button,
batteries, and switch. The boxes, wall-plates, etc.,
etc., are but accessories to which the active parts are attached.</p>

<p>The first telephone that came into general use was the
invention of Graham Bell, and the principle of his receiver
has not been materially changed from that day to this, except
that now a double-pole magnet and two fine wire coils
are employed in place of the single magnet and one coil. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span>
practical form of single magnet receiver that any boy can
easily construct is shown in <a href="#FigVIII4">Fig. 4</a>, and <a href="#FigVIII5">Fig. 5</a> is a sectional
drawing of the receiver drawn as though it had been sliced
or sawed in two, from front to rear.</p>

<p>It is made from a piece of curtain-pole one inch and an
eighth in diameter and three inches and a half long. A hole
three-eighths of an inch in diameter is bored its entire
length at the middle, and through this the magnet passes.
At one end of this tube a wooden pill-box (E) is made fast
with glue, or a wooden cup may be turned out on a lathe
and attached to the magnet tube. If the pill-box is employed
it should be two inches and a half in diameter, and
at four equidistant places inside the box small lugs of wood
are to be glued fast. Into these lugs the screws employed
to hold the cap are driven. The walls of pill-boxes are so
thin that without these lugs the cap could not be fastened
over the thin disk of metal (D) unless it were tied or wired
on, and that would not look well. If the cup is turned the
walls should be left thick enough to pass the screws into,
and the inside diameter should then be one inch and three-quarters.</p>

<div class="container m40">

<div class="figcenter nomargin" id="FigVIII5">
<img src="images/illo162a.jpg" alt="Telephone" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The cap (B) is made from thin wood, fibre, or hard rubber.
It is provided with a thin rim or collar to separate its inner
side from the face of the disk (D). Four small holes are bored
near the edge of this cap, so that the screws which hold it
fast to the cup (E) may pass through them. The magnet (M)
is a piece of hard steel three-eighths of an inch in diameter
and four inches and a quarter long. This may be purchased
at a supply-house, and if it is not hard enough a blacksmith
can make it so by heating and plunging it in cold water<span class="pagenum" id="Page162">[162]</span>
several times. It may be magnetized by rubbing it over
the surface of a large horseshoe magnet, or if you live near
a power station you can get one of the workmen to magnetize
it for you at a trifling cost. Should you happen to possess a
bar magnet of soft iron with a number of coils of wire, and
also a storage-battery, the steel bar may be substituted for
the soft iron core and the current turned on. After five<span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span>
minutes the steel can be withdrawn. It is now a magnet,
and will hold its magnetism indefinitely.</p>

<p>Now have a thin, flat spool turned from maple or boxwood
to fit over one end of the rod, and wind it with a number
of layers of No. 36 copper wire insulated with silk.
This is known in the electrical supply-houses as “phone”-receiver
insulated wire, and will cost about fifty cents an
ounce. One ounce will be enough for two receivers. It
should be wound evenly and smoothly, like the strands of
thread on a spool, and this may be done with the aid of
the winder described on <a href="#Page58">page 58</a>.</p>

<p>When the wire is in place a drop of hot paraffine will
hold the end so that the wire will not unwind. The ends
of this spool-winding should be made fast to heavier wires,
which are run through small holes in the tube (A) and project
out at the end, as shown at F F. The magnet, with its
wire-wound spool on the end, is then pushed through the
hole in A until the top end of the rod is slightly below the
edges of the cup (E), so that when the metal disk (D) is laid
over the cup (E) the space between the magnet and disk, or
diaphragm (D), is one-sixteenth of an inch (see <a href="#FigVIII5">Fig. 5</a>). Put
some shellac on the magnet, so that when it is in the right
place the shellac will dry and hold it fast.</p>

<p>The cap (B) holds the disk (D) in place, and protects the
spool and its fine wire from being damaged and from collecting
dust. After giving the exterior a coat of black paint
and a finishing coat or two of shellac, the receiver will be
ready for use.</p>

<p>The original telephone apparatus was made up of these
receivers only&mdash;one at each of a line in connection with<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
a battery, bell, push-button, and switch. On a window-casing,
or the wall through which the wires passed, a lightning-arrester
was arranged and made fast. Using receivers
only, it was necessary to speak through the same instrument
that one heard through, and for a few years this unhandy
method of communication was the only one possible. Then
the transmitter was invented.</p>

<h4>Plan of Installation</h4>

<p>Many of these single-receiver lines are still in use, and as
they require but a small amount of constructive skill a
diagram of the wiring and the plan of arrangement is shown
in <a href="#FigVIII6">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

<p>At the left side, R is the receiver at one end of the line
and R 2 that at the other, line No. 1 being a continuous
wire between the two receivers. When the boy at R wishes
to call his friend at R 2 he uses his push-button (P B), and
the battery (B B) operates the electric bell (E B 2) at the
other end. In order to have the bell connections operative,
the switch (S 2) must be thrown over to the left when the
line is “quiet,” while the switch (S) should be thrown to the
right. With the switches in this position the boy at either
end may call his friend at the opposite end.</p>

<p>With the switch (S 2) thrown to the left (the position it
should be in, except when talking over the line), the boy at
the other end pushes his button (P B), first throwing switch
S to the left. This makes connection for the battery (B B),
and the circuit is closed through wires that join line No. 1
and line No. 2 at 1 and 2. The branch lines to the bell<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
(E B 2) join the main lines at 3 and 4, through switch S 2,
when the bar is thrown to the left. The circuit being complete,
the batteries (B B) at one end of the line ring the bell
(E B 2) at the other end of the line.</p>

<p>In the reverse manner, when the switch (S) is thrown to
the right, the boy at the opposite end rings the bell (E B)
by pressing on the button (P B 2), first throwing switch S 2
over to the right. If the boy at the left is calling up the
boy at the right, the switch (S) should be thrown to the left,
and he keeps ringing until the other operator throws switch
S 2 over to the right. If now he has the receiver (R) up to
his ear he can hear the vibration of the bell (E B 2) ringing
through the receiver (R) at his end of the line. But when
the boy summoned to R 2 takes up the receiver and places
it to his ear, he throws switch S 2 over to the right side, and
the boy at R leaves switch S over on the left side. This
brings the lines into direct connection with the receivers in
series. Be careful, when setting up this line, to have the
batteries (B B) in series with B 2 B 2; otherwise there would
be counter-action. The carbon of one cell should be connected
with the zinc of the next cell, and so on.</p>

<p>Another receiver is shown at <a href="#FigVIII7">Fig. 7</a>. The tube (A) and
the cup are turned from one piece of wood, and the cap (B)
from another piece. The length of the receiver is five inches,
and the cap is two inches and a half across. The shank, or
handle, through which the magnet is passed measures one
inch and a quarter in diameter.</p>

<p>These wood parts will have to be made by a wood-turner;
and before the long piece is put in a lathe the hole, three-eighths
of an inch in diameter, should be bored. It must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page166">[166]</span>
done carefully, so that the wood shell will be of even thickness
all around the hole. Also two small holes should be
made the entire length of the handle, through which the
wires leading from the coil to the binding-posts may
pass.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The spool for the fine insulated wire coil is turned from
box-wood or maple, and wound as described in <a href="#Page54">chapter iv.</a>,
on Magnets and Induction-coils. Small binding-posts (F F)
with screw ends should be driven down into the holes at
the end of the handle and over the bare ends of the wires
that project out of the holes. The magnet (M) is three-eighths
of an inch in diameter, and is provided with the
spool and coil (C) at the large end of the receiver.</p>

<p>The disk (D) is of very thin iron, and is held in place by the
cap (B) and four small brass screws driven through the edge
of B and into the cup end of A. A screw-eye should be
driven into the small end of the receiver from which it may
hang from a hook. If a double hook and bar is employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span>
the receiver will hang in the fork, being held there by the
rim of wood turned at the small end of A.</p>

<h4>A Double-pole Receiver</h4>

<p>Another form of receiver is shown at <a href="#FigVIII8">Fig. 8</a>. This is a
double-pole receiver, with the coils of fine wire arranged on
the ends of a bent band of steel and located in the cup (A),
so that the ends of the magnet are close to the diaphragm
(D). <a href="#FigVIII8">Fig. 8</a> is a sectional view of an assembled receiver, but
a good idea can be had from the drawings of the separate
parts. The magnet (M) is of steel one-eighth of an inch thick<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
and five-eighths of an inch wide. A blacksmith will make
this at a small cost. It should measure two and one-half
inches wide, two and one-half inches long, the ends being
five-eighths of an inch apart.</p>

<div class="container m40" id="FigVIII8">

<div class="figcenter nomargin">

</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Thin wooden spools are made from wood or fibre to fit
over the steel ends, and are wound with No. 36 silk-insulated
wire. A wooden cup, or shell (A), is turned from cherry,
maple, or other close-grained wood, and at the back a hole
is cut just large enough for the magnet ends to slip through
exclusive of the coils wound on them. A plug of wood (A A)
is driven between the ends of the magnet to hold them in
place. Some shellac on the edges of the hole and the plug
will harden and keep the parts in place.</p>

<p>The coils (C C) are placed on the magnet ends, and the fine
wires are made fast to the binding-posts (E E), the latter being
screwed fast to the shell (A). The diaphragm (D) is then
arranged in place and held with the cap (B) and the small
screws which pass through it and into the shell (A).</p>

<h4>The Transmitter</h4>

<p>With any one of these receivers a more complete and
convenient telephone can be made by the addition of a
transmitter and an induction-coil.</p>

<p>Following the invention of the receiver, several transmitters
were designed and patented, among them being
the Edison, Blake, Clamond, Western Union, and Hunning.
The Edison and Hunning are the ones in general use, and
as either of them can easily be made by a boy a simplified
type of both is shown in <a href="#FigVIII9">Figs. 9 and 11</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">SIMPLIFIED TYPE OF TRANSMITTER</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span></p>

<p>Some small blocks of wood, tin funnels, small screws,
granulated or powdered carbon, some thin pieces of flat
carbon, and a piece of very thin ferrotype plate will be the
principal things needed in making a transmitter similar to
the one shown in <a href="#FigVIII9">Fig. 9</a>. All that is visible from the outside
is a plate of wood screwed to a block of wood, and a
mouth-piece made fast to the thin board.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FigVIII10">Fig. 10</a> an interior section is shown, which when once
understood will be found extremely simple. The block (A) is
of pine, white-wood, birch, or cherry, and is two inches and
three-quarters square and five-eighths or three-quarters of
an inch thick. A hole seven-eighths of an inch in diameter
is bored in the centre of this block, half an inch deep, and
a path is cut at the face of the block one inch and a half
in diameter and one-eighth of an inch deep. Be careful to
cut these holes accurately and smoothly, and if it is not
possible to do so, it would be well to have them put in a
lathe and turned out.</p>

<p>The face-plate (B) is two inches square, with a three-quarter-inch
hole in it, and the under-side is cut away for one-eighth
of an inch in depth and one inch and a half in diameter.
The object of these depressions in block A and
face-plate B is to give space for the diaphragm (D) to
vibrate when the voice falls on it through the mouth-piece
(C).</p>

<p>From carbon one-eighth of an inch in thickness two
round buttons are cut measuring three-quarters of an inch
across. A small hole is bored in the centre of each button,
and one of them is provided with a very small brass screw
and nut, as shown at F F. One side of the button-hole is<span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span>
countersunk, so that the head of the screw will fit down
into it and be flush with the face of the carbon. With a
small three-cornered or square file cut the surface of the
buttons with criss-cross lines, as shown at F F. When the
buttons are mounted in the receiver these surfaces will face
each other. Cut a small washer from felt or flannel, and
place it in the bottom of the hole in block A. Line the side
of the hole with a narrow strip of the same goods; then
place the button (F F) in the hole, pass the screw through the
hole and through the block (A), and make it fast with the
nut, as shown at F. Place a thin, flat washer under the nut,
and twist a fine piece of insulated copper wire between
washer and nut for terminal connections, taking care that
the end of the wire under the nut is bare and bright, so that
perfect contact is assured. Since the practice of telephony
involves such delicate and sensitive vibratory and electrical
phenomena, it is best to solder all joints and unions wherever
practicable, and so avoid the possibility of loose connections
or corrosion of united wires.</p>

<p>From very thin ferrotype plate cut a piece two inches
square, and at the middle of it attach the other carbon button
by means of a small rivet which you can make from a
piece of copper wire. Or a very small brass machine screw
may be passed through the button and plate; then gently
tapped at the face of the plate to rivet it fast, as shown
at E. Lay the block down flat and partly fill the cavity
with carbon granules until the button is covered. Do not
fill up to the top of the hole. Over this lay the disk (D), so
that the carbon button at the under side of it will fit in the
top part of the hole between the sides of felt or flannel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span>
Make the disk fast to the block (A) with small pins made by
clipping ordinary pins in half and filing the ends.</p>

<p>A slim bolt (G) is passed through the block (A), and a wire
terminal is caught under a nut and between a washer at
the back of the block, as described for F. The japan or
lacquer must be scraped away from the disk (D) where the
bolt-head touches it, so that perfect electrical contact will
be the result.</p>

<p>A small tin funnel is cut and made fast to the face-plate
(B), or if an electrical supply-house is at hand a mouth-piece
of hard rubber or composition may be had for a few cents.
The block (B) is then screwed fast to A, forming the transmitter
shown at <a href="#FigVIII9">Fig. 9</a>. When this transmitter stands in a
vertical position the granules, or small particles of carbon,
drop down between the buttons of carbon, packing closely
at the bottom of the cavity. At the middle they are loosely
placed, and at the top there are none. As the high or low
vibrations of the voice fall on the disk (D) they act accordingly
on the carbon granules, which in turn conduct the
vibrations to the rear carbon button, and, by the aid of
electricity reproduce the same sound, in high or low tone,
through the receiver at the other end of a line.</p>

<p>This improved transmitter makes it possible to talk in a
moderate tone of voice over distances up to one thousand
miles, while with the old form of the instrument it was
necessary to talk very loud in order to be heard only a few
miles away. Where a portable apparatus is desired, this
block may be attached to a box or an upright staff.</p>

<p>This transmitter will not work when on its back or so
that the funnel is on top, because the particles of carbon<span class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span>
would settle on the rear button and not touch the front
one. It is essential that the carbon grains should touch
both buttons at the same time, and at the lower part of the
cavity they should lie quite solid. It is not necessary, however,
to pack it in, for the vibratory action of the voice, or
other sounds, will cause the particles to adjust themselves
and settle in a compact mass.</p>

<h4>Another Form of Transmitter</h4>

<p>In <a href="#FigVIII11">Fig. 11</a> another style of transmitter is shown. It is
assembled on the front of a box. This front or cover swings
on hinges, and can be opened so that the mechanism in the
interior of the box may be gotten at easily.</p>

<p>A sectional view of this transmitter is shown in <a href="#FigVIII12">Fig. 12</a>.
A hole one inch and a half in diameter is cut in the cover (A).
A round or square block (B) two inches and a quarter across
and half an inch thick is made fast to the rear of the cover,
and in this a hole is bored seven-eighths of an inch in diameter
and one-quarter of an inch deep.</p>

<p>The sides and bottom of this hole are lined with flannel
or felt, and a carbon button with roughened surface, as
shown at F F, is made fast in it by a small machine screw
and nut (F). A diaphragm (D) is cut from thin ferrotype
plate, and a carbon button is made fast to the middle of it
by a small machine screw or a rivet made from soft copper
or brass. When the block (B) has been screwed fast to A,
place some granules of carbon in the space (H); then lay the
diaphragm over the opening, and make it fast with small
screws or pins driven around the edge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page174">[174]</span></p>

<p>From a small tin funnel and a tin-can cap make a mouth-piece
(C) by cutting a hole in the cap and slipping the funnel
through it, then cutting the end of the funnel that projects
through the hole and bending back the ears so that they
lap on the inner side of the cap. These small ears may be
soldered to the cap so as to hold the mouth-piece securely in
place. From felt or flannel cut a washer the size of the
can top and about three-eighths of an inch in width. Lay
this over the diaphragm; then place the mouth-piece on it
and fasten it to the door (A) with small screws. The use of
this washer is to prevent any false vibrations in the mouth-piece
affecting the sensitive diaphragm. Make a small hole
through A and B and pass a bolt (E) through this hole,
taking care to lap a thin piece of sheet-brass on the
diaphragm (D), bending it over so that it will lie under the
head of the bolt (E). The diaphragm must be scraped where
the metal touches it, so as to make perfect electrical connection
between D and E. At the rear end of E arrange
a washer and nut (G), so that the current passing in at G
travels through E and D, then through the carbon buttons
and granules, and out at F.</p>

<p>From pine or white-wood one-quarter or three-eighths
of an inch thick make a box four inches wide, six inches
high, and two inches and a half deep. To the front of this
attach a cover, which should measure a quarter of an inch
larger all around than the width and height of the box.
Use brass hinges for this work so that the cover may be
opened. Fasten a transmitter to the front of the cover, or
make one on the cover, as shown in <a href="#FigVIII11">Fig. 11</a>, and attach the
box to a back-board or wall-plate five inches wide and<span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span>
seven inches high made of pine or white-wood half an inch
in thickness (see <a href="#FigVIII13">Fig. 13</a>).</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>At the left side of the box cut a slot through the wood,
so that a lever and hook may project and work up and
down. The end of this lever is provided with a hook on
which a receiver may be hung, as shown in <a href="#FigVIII13">Fig. 13</a>, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page176">[176]</span>
inside mechanism is arranged as shown at <a href="#FigVIII14">Fig. 14</a>. A is
an angle-piece of brass or copper, which acts as a bracket
and which is screwed fast to the inside of the box. B is the
lever and hook, which is cut from a strip of brass. The
attached end is made wider, and an ear (C), to which a wire
is soldered, projects down beyond the screw.</p>

<p>A view looking down on this lever and bracket is shown
at <a href="#FigVIII15">Fig. 15</a>. A is the bracket, B the lever, and E the screw
or bolt holding the two parts together, with a thin copper
washer between them to prevent friction. When the lever
and bracket are made fast to the box, a spring (D) should
be arranged, so that when the receiver is removed from the
hook the lever will be drawn up to the top of the slot. A
small contact-plate (F) is made of brass, and fastened at the
lower end of the slot. On this the lever should rest when
the receiver is on the hook. A contact-wire is soldered to
this plate, which in turn is screwed fast to the inside of
the box. This mechanism is part of a make-and-break
switch to cut out and cut in the bells or telephone, and
will be more clearly understood by referring to the diagram
in <a href="#FigVIII17">Fig. 17</a>. At the right side of the box a small push-button
is made fast, and this, with two binding-posts at the top
and four at the underside of the box, will complete the
exterior equipment of one end of a line.</p>

<p>The construction of the push-button is shown in <a href="#FigVIII16">Fig. 16</a>, A
being the box and B the button which passes through a small
hole made in the side of the box. C is a strip of spring-brass
screwed fast to the box. It must be strong enough
to press the small bone or hard rubber button towards the
outside of the box. A wire is caught under one screw-head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page177">[177]</span>
and another one is passed under the screw-head which holds
the other spring (D) to the box. When the button (B) is
pushed in, it brings spring C into contact with D, and the
circuit is closed. Directly the finger is removed from B
the spring (C) pushes it out and breaks the circuit. This
button is used only in connection with the call-bells, and has
nothing to do with the telephone. The wires leading from
the interior of the box pass through the wall-plate and along
in grooves to the foot of the binding-posts, which are arranged
below the box on the back-board, as shown in <a href="#FigVIII13">Fig. 13</a>.</p>

<p>A buzzer or bell is made fast to the inside of the box,
unless it is too large to fit conveniently, in which case it
may be attached to the wall above or below the box.</p>

<h4>The Wiring System</h4>

<p><a href="#FigVIII17">Fig. 17</a> shows the wiring system for this outfit, which,
when properly set up and connected, should operate on a
circuit or line several miles in length, provided that the
batteries are strong enough.</p>

<p>This system may be installed in the box shown in <a href="#FigVIII13">Fig. 13</a>,
the flexible cord containing two wires being attached to the
binding-posts at the top of the box and to the posts at the
end of the receiver. This system differs from the one shown
in <a href="#FigVIII6">Fig. 6</a> only in the addition of receivers T and T 2, and in
the substitution of the automatic lever-switches (L S and
L S 2) for the plain switches (S and S 2) in <a href="#FigVIII6">Fig. 6</a>. When the
line is “quiet” the receiver (R) should be hanging on the
lever-switch (L S), which rests on the contact-plate (A). At
the opposite side of the line the receiver (R 2) hangs on the
lever-switch (L S 2), which in turn rests on the contact-plate
(A A). This puts the bell circuit in service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page179">[179]</span></p>

<p>If the boy at the left wishes to call up the boy at the
right he removes the receiver (R) from the hook (L S) and
presses on the button (P B). This closes the circuit through
the battery (C C C), and operates the electric buzzer or bell
(E B 2) at the other end of the system, through line No. 1
and line No. 2. The operation may be clearly understood
by following the lines in the drawing with a pointer. The
boy at the left may keep on calling the boy at the right so
long as the receiver (R 2) hangs on the lever (L S 2) and holds
it down against the plate (A A). But directly the receiver
(R 2) is removed, the lever (L S 2) flies up&mdash;being drawn upward
by the spring (D) shown in <a href="#FigVIII14">Fig. 14</a>&mdash;and closes the telephone
circuit through the spring-contact (B B), at the same
time cutting out the bell circuit. The boy at the left having
already removed his receiver, the telephone circuit is then
complete through lines Nos. 1 and 2 and batteries C C C and
C 2 C 2 C 2, the boys at both ends speaking into the transmitters
and hearing through the receivers. The contacts
B and B B are made from spring-brass or copper, and are
attached inside the boxes at the back, so that when the
levers are up contact is made, but when down the circuit
is broken or opened. In <a href="#FigVIII18">Fig. 18</a> an interior view of a box
is shown, the door being thrown open and the receiver left
hanging on the hook.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the several parts will be found convenient
and easy of access. E B is the electric buzzer, L S
the lever-switch, P B the push-button, T the transmitter,
and R the receiver. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are binding-posts
or terminals, and B is the spring-contact against
which the lever-switch (L S) strikes when drawn up by the
spring (D).</p>

<p>The wires that pass from 6 to 7 and from 4 to 8 should be
soldered fast to one side of the hinge, and those running
from the terminals or nuts at the back of the transmitter (T)
to 7 and 8 should be similarly secured. Small brass hinges
are not liable to become corroded at the joints, but to insure
against any such possibility the ends of several fine wires
may be soldered to each leaf of the hinge, so that when the
door is closed the wires will be compressed between the
hinge-plates. For long-distance communication it will be
necessary to install an induction-coil, so that the direct current
furnished by the batteries, in series with the transmitter,
can by induction be transformed into alternating
current over the lines connecting the two sets of apparatus.
This system is somewhat more complicated and requires
more care in making the connections, but once in operation
it will be found far superior to either of the systems hitherto
described.</p>

<h4>A Telephone Induction-coil</h4>

<p>It will be necessary to make two induction-coils, as described
in <a href="#Page54">chapter iv.</a>, <a href="#Page62">page 62</a>, <a href="#FigVIII8">Fig. 8</a>. A telephone coil
for moderately long-distance circuits is made on a wooden
spool turned from a piece of wood three inches and a half
long and one inch square, as shown at <a href="#FigVIII19">Fig. 19</a>. The core-sheath
is turned down so that it is about one-sixteenth of
an inch thick. This spool is given a coat or two of shellac,<span class="pagenum" id="Page182">[182]</span>
and two holes are made at each end, as shown in the drawing.
The first winding or primary coil is made up of two
layers of No. 20 double-insulated copper wire, one end projecting
from a hole at one end of the spool, the other from
a hole at the other end. This coil is given two or three
thin coats of shellac to bind the strands of wire and thoroughly
insulate them, and over the layer a piece of paper
is to be wrapped and shellacked. The secondary coil is
made up of twelve layers of No. 34 silk-insulated copper
wire, and between each layer a sheet of paper should be
wound so that it will make two complete wraps. Each
paper separator should be given a coat of shellac or hot
paraffine; then the turns of wire should be continued just
as thread is wound upon a spool, smoothly, closely, and
evenly, until the last wrap is on. Three or four wraps of
paper should be fastened on the coil to protect it, and it
may then be screwed fast inside a box. The core-hole

UP TO FIVE HUNDRED MILES APART.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span></p>

<p>The wiring is comparatively simple, and may be easily
followed if the description and plan are constantly consulted
when setting up the line. R and R 2 are the receivers, T
and T 2 the transmitters, C 1 and C 2 the batteries, E B and
E B 2 the buzzers or bells, P B and P B 2 the push-buttons,
and L S and L S 2 the lever-switches. For convenience of
illustration the induction-coils are separated. The primary
coil (P C) is indicated by the heavy spring line and the secondary
coil (S C) by the fine spring line. When the line is
“dead” both receivers are hanging from the hooks of the
lever-switches. If the boy at the left wishes to call the boy
at the right he lifts the receiver (R) from the hook (L S) and
presses the button (P B). This throws the battery (C 1 C 1 C 1)
in circuit with lines Nos. 1 and 2, and operates the buzzer
(E B 2). When the boy at the right lifts his receiver (R 2) from
the hook (L S 2), the bell circuit is cut out and the ’phone
circuit is cut in. When the lever-switches are drawn up
against the contact-springs (A, B, and C and A A, B B, and
C C), both batteries are thrown into circuit with the transmitters
at their respective ends through the primary coils
(P C and P C 2). By inductance through the secondary coils
(S C and S C 2), lines Nos. 1 and 2 are electrified, and when
the voice strikes the disks in the transmitters the same tone
and vibration is heard through the receivers at the other
end of the line. While conversation is going on the batteries
at either end are being drawn upon or depleted; but as soon
as the receivers are hung on the hooks and the lever-switches
are drawn away from the contact-springs, the flow of current
is stopped. The buzzers or bells consume but a small
amount of current when operated, and in dry cells the active
parts recuperate quickly and depolarize. The greatest
drain on a battery, therefore, is when the line is closed for
conversation.</p>

<h4>An Installation Plan</h4>

<p>A simple manner in which to install this apparatus in
boxes is shown in <a href="#FigVIII22">Fig. 22</a>. The box is depicted with the
front opened and with the receiver hanging on the hook.<span class="pagenum" id="Page185">[185]</span>
When the lever-switch (L S) is down it rests on the contact-spring
(A), thus throwing in the bell circuit. When the boy
at the other end of the line pushes the button on his box
it operates the buzzer (E B). This can be understood by following
with a pointer the wires from the buzzer to the
outlet-posts (Nos. 1 and 3) at the bottom of the wall-plate.</p>

<div class="container m40" id="FigVIII22">

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo185.jpg" alt="Telephone" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>When the receiver (R) is lifted from the hook (L S), it cuts<span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span>
out the bell circuit and cuts in the telephone circuit, through
the spring-contacts (B and C). This circuit may easily be
followed through the wires connecting transmitter, receiver,
induction-coil, and batteries. The heavy lines leading out
from the induction-coil are the primary coil wires, and the
fine hair lines are those forming the secondary coil. The
medium lines are those that connect the binding-posts,
batteries, and lines.</p>

<p>When the bell circuit is connected the impulse coming
from the other end of the line enters through wire No. 10
to post No. 3, thence to strip E and plate G, and so on to
E B, which it operates. The current then passes from E B
to contact A, through L S to post No. 1, and out on wire
No. 11.</p>

<p>To operate the buzzer at other end of the line the button
(P B) is pushed in. This moves the spring (E) away from the
plate (G), and brings it into contact with F. This connects
the circuit through the battery wire (No. 8) to post No. 1 to
line No. 11 without going into the box, and from wire No.
9 to post No. 2; thence to hinge No. 7 to plate F, through
E, down to post No. 3, and out through wire No. 10. In
this manner the current is taken from the batteries at the
foot of wires Nos. 8 and 9, and used to ring the buzzer at the
other end of the line.</p>

<p>When the hook (L S) is up the circuit is closed through T,
I C, and battery. The current runs from the battery through
wire No. 8 to post No. 1, to L S, through C and primary coil
out to hinge No. 6, through transmitter to hinge No. 7, to
post No. 2, and back to battery through wire No. 9.</p>

<p>By inductance the sound is carried over the line, in at<span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span>
wire No. 10, to post No. 3, through secondary coil to post
No. 4, through receiver R to post No. 5, through B and
L S to post No. 1, and out through wire No. 11. At the
other end of the line it goes through the same parts
of the apparatus.</p>

<h4>A Portable Apparatus</h4>

<p>For convenience it is often desirable to have a portable
transmitter, and so avoid the inconvenience of having to
stand while speaking. A neat portable apparatus that will
stand on a ledge or table, and which may be moved about
within the radius of the connecting lines, is shown in <a href="#FigVIII23">Fig. 23</a>.</p>

<p>The wooden base is four inches square and the upright
one inch and a half square. The stand is twelve inches
high over all, and on the bottom a plate of iron or lead must
be screwed fast to make it bottom-heavy, so that it will not
topple over.</p>

<p>The lever-switch may be arranged at the back of the
upright and the push-button at the front near the base, as
shown at A. The wall-box contains the buzzer and induction-coil,
and within it the wiring is arranged from the portable
stand to the batteries and line as shown at C. This
illustration is too small, however, to show the complete
wiring, and the young electrician is therefore referred to
<a href="#FigVIII22">Fig. 22</a>. The battery (B) is composed of as many dry or
wet cells as may be required to operate the line. These
must be connected in series at both ends. At D a rear view
of the upright and transmitter is shown to illustrate the
manner in which the wiring can be done. If a hollow upright
is made of four thin pieces of wood a much neater
appearance may be secured by enclosing the wires.</p>

<p>In all of these telephone systems one wire must lead to
the ground, or be connected with a water-pipe, taking care,
however, to solder the wire to a galvanized pipe so that
perfect contact will be the result. If the wire is carried
directly to the ground it must be attached to a plate, which
in turn is buried deep enough to reach moist earth, as
described in the chapter on Line and Wireless Telegraphs,
<a href="#Page215">page 215</a>.</p>

<p>Care and accuracy will lead to success in telephony, but
one slip or error will throw the best system out of order
and render it useless. This, indeed, applies to all electrical
apparatus; there can be no half-way; it will either work
or it won’t.</p>

<h4>A Ground Telegraph</h4>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">N</span><span class="afterlargecap">early</span>
every boy is interested in telegraphy, and it
is a fascinating field for study and experimental work,
to say nothing of the amusement to be gotten out of it.
The instruments are not difficult to make, and two boys
can easily have a line between their houses.</p>

<p>The key is a modified form of the push-button, and is
simply a contact maker and breaker for opening and closing
an electrical circuit. A practical telegraph-key is
shown in <a href="#FigIX1">Fig. 1</a>, and in <a href="#FigIX2">Fig. 2</a> is given the side elevation.</p>

<p>The base-board is four inches wide, six inches long, and
half an inch in thickness. At the front end a small metal
connector-plate is screwed fast, and through a hole in the
middle of it a brass-headed upholsterer’s tack is driven for
the underside of the key to strike against. Two <span class="symbol">L</span> pieces
of metal are bent and attached to the middle of the board
to support the key-bar, and at the rear of the board another
upholsterer’s tack is driven in the wood for the end
of the bar to strike on and make a click. The bar is of
brass or iron, measuring three-eighths by half an inch, and
is provided with a hole bored at an equal distance from each<span class="pagenum" id="Page191">[191]</span>
end for a small bolt to pass through, in order to pivot it
between the <span class="symbol">L</span> plates. A hole made at the forward end
will admit a brass screw that in turn will hold a spool-end
to act as a finger-piece. The screw should be cut off and
riveted at the underside. A short, strong spring is to be
attached to the back of the base-block and to the end of
the key-bar by means of a hook, which may be made from<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
a steel-wire nail flattened. It is bound to the top of the
bar with wire, as shown in <a href="#FigIX2">Figs. 2</a> and <a href="#FigIX3">3</a>.</p>

<p>The incoming and outgoing wires are made fast to one
end of the connector-plate and to one of the <span class="symbol">L</span> pieces that
support the key. When the key is at rest the circuit is
open, but when pressed down against the brass tack it is
closed, and whether pressed down or released it clicks at
both movements. A simple switch may be connected with
the <span class="symbol">L</span>-plate and the connection-post at the opposite side of
the key-base, so that, if necessary, the circuit may be
closed. Or an arm may be caught under the screw at the
<span class="symbol">L</span>-plate, and brought forward so that it can be thrown in
against a screw-head on the connector-plate, as shown in
<a href="#FigIX3">Fig. 3</a>. The screw-head may be flattened with a file, and
the underside of the switch bevelled at the edges, so that
it will mount easily on the screw.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FigIX4">Fig. 4</a> (page 191) a simple telegraph-sounder is shown.
A base-board, four inches wide, six inches long, and seven-eighths
of an inch in thickness, is made of hard-wood, and
two holes are bored, with the centres two inches from one end,
so that the lower nuts of the horseshoe magnet will fit in
them, as shown in <a href="#FigIX5">Fig. 5</a>. This allows the yoke to rest flat
on the top of the base, and with a stout screw passed down
through a hole in the middle of the yoke and into the wood
the magnets are held in an upright position.</p>

<p>From the base-block to the top of the bolt the magnets
are two inches and a quarter high. The bar of brass or
iron to which the armature (A in <a href="#FigIX5">Fig. 5</a>) is attached is four
inches and a half in length and three-eighths by half an
inch thick. At the middle of the bar and through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span>
side a hole is bored, through which a small bolt may be
passed to hold it between the upright blocks of wood. At
the front end two small holes are to be bored, so that its
armature may be riveted to it with brass escutcheon-pins
or slim round-headed screws. The heads are at the top
and the riveting is underneath. A small block of wood is
cut, as shown in <a href="#FigIX6">Fig. 6</a>, against which the two upright
pieces of wood are made fast. This block is two inches
and a half long, one inch and a quarter high, and seven-eighths
of an inch wide. The laps cut from each side are
an inch wide and a quarter of an inch deep, to receive the
uprights of the same dimensions.</p>

<p>At the top of this block a brass-headed nail is driven
for the underside of the bar to strike on. A hook and spring
are to be attached to the rear of the sounder-bar, as described
for the key, and at the front of the base two binding-posts
are arranged, to which the loose ends of the coil-wires
are attached.</p>

<p>Just behind the yoke, and directly under the armature-bar,
a long screw is driven into the base-block, as shown
at B in <a href="#FigIX5">Fig. 5</a>. It must not touch the yoke, and the head
should be less than one-eighth of an inch below the bar
when at rest. On this the armature-bar strikes and clicks
when drawn to the magnets. The armature must not
touch the magnets; otherwise the residual magnetism
would hold it down. The screw must be nicely adjusted,
so that a loud, clear click will result.</p>

<p class="caption">TELEGRAPH KEY AND SOUNDER</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span></p>

<p>When the sounder is at rest the rear end lies on the brass
tack in the block, and the armature is about a quarter of
an inch above the top of the magnets. The armature is of
soft iron, two inches and a half long, seven-eighths of an
inch wide, and an eighth of an inch thick. These small
scraps of metal may be procured at a blacksmith’s shop,
and, for a few cents, he will bore the holes in the required
places; or if you have a breast or hand drill the metal
may be held in a vise and properly perforated.</p>

<p>By connecting one wire from the key directly with one of
the binding-posts of the sounder, and the other with the
poles of a battery, and so on to the sounder, the apparatus
is ready for use. By pressing on the key the circuit is
closed, and the magnetism of the sounder-cores draws the
armature down with a click. On releasing the key the bar
flies back to rest, having been pulled down by the spring,
and it clicks on the brass tack-head. These two instruments
may be placed any distance apart, miles if necessary,
so long as sufficient current is employed to work the sounder.
Two sets of instruments must be made if boys in separate
houses are to have a line. Each one must have a key,
sounder, and cell, or several cells connected in series to form
a battery, according to the current required.</p>

<p>In the plan of the telegraph-line connections (<a href="#FigIX7">Fig. 7</a>, page
196) a clear idea is given for the wiring; and if the line and
return wires are to be very long, it would be best to have them
of No. 14 galvanized telegraph-wire, copper being too expensive,
although much better. These wires must not touch
each other, and when attached to a house, barn, or trees,
porcelain or glass insulators should be used. If nothing
better can be had, the necks of some stout glass bottles may
be held with wooden pins or large nails, and the wire twisted
to them, as shown in <a href="#FigIX8">Fig. 8</a>. When the line is not in use<span class="pagenum" id="Page196">[196]</span>
the switches on both keys should be closed; otherwise it
would be impossible for the boy having the closed switch
to call up the boy with the open one. Take great care in
wiring your apparatus to study the plan, for a misconnected
wire will throw the whole system out of order.</p>

<p>To operate the line see that all switches are closed and
that the connections are in good condition. When the boy
in house No. 2 wants to call up his friend in house No. 1
he throws open the switchon key, as shown in the <a href="#FigIX7">plan</a>,
and by pressing down on the finger-key his sounder and
that in house No. 1 click simultaneously. As soon as he
raises or releases the key the armatures rise, making the
up-click. If he presses his key and releases it quickly the
two clicks on the sounder in house No. 1 are close together;
this makes what is called a dot. If the key is held down<span class="pagenum" id="Page197">[197]</span>
longer it makes a long time between clicks, and this is called
a dash. The dot and dash are the two elements of the
telegraphic code. You will understand that the boy in
house No. 2 hears just what the one in No. 1 is hearing,
since the electric current passing through both coils causes
the magnets to act in unison. So soon as the operator in
house No. 2 has finished he closes his switch, and the other
in house No. 1 opens his switch on the key and begins his
reply. This is the simple principle of the telegraph, and
all the improved apparatus is based on it, no matter how
complicated. The complete Morse alphabet is appended:</p>

<p class="caption morse"><b>The Morse Telegraph Code</b></p>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">

</div><!--container-->

<p>Any persevering boy can soon learn the dot-and-dash
letters of the Morse code, and very quickly become a fairly<span class="pagenum" id="Page198">[198]</span>
good operator. Telegraphic messages are sent and received
in this way, and are read by the sound of the clicks.
Various kinds of recording instruments are also employed,
so that when an operator is away from his table the automatic
recorder takes down the message on a paper tape.
In the stock-ticker, employed in brokerage offices, the
recording is done by letters and numerals, and the paper
tape drops into a basket beside the machine, so that any
one picking up the strip of paper can see the quotations
from the opening of business up to the time of reading
them. These quotations are sent out directly from the
floor of the exchanges, and by the action of one man’s hand
thousands of machines are set in operation all over the city.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most unique and wonderful telegraphic
signal-apparatus is that located on the floor of the New
York Produce Exchange and the Chicago Exchange. The
dials, side by side, are operated by direct wire from Chicago.
When the New York operator flashes a quotation it appears
simultaneously on the New York dial and simultaneously
on the Chicago dial, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Electrical instruments are not the only means by which
the Morse alphabet may be transmitted, for in some instances
instruments would be in the way, while in others
the wires might be down and communication cut off.</p>

<p>This is interestingly illustrated by an event in Thomas
A. Edison’s life. When he was a boy and an apprentice
telegraph operator on the Grand Trunk Line, an ice-jam
had broken the cable between Port Huron, in Michigan,
and Sarnia, in Canada, so that communication by electricity
was cut off. The river at that point is a mile and<span class="pagenum" id="Page199">[199]</span>
a half wide, the ice made the passage impossible, and there
was no way of repairing the cable. Edison impulsively
jumped on a locomotive standing near the river-bank and
seized the whistle-cord.</p>

<p>He had an idea that blasts of the whistle might be broken
into long and short sounds corresponding to the dots and
dashes of the Morse code. In a moment the whistle sounded
over the river: “Toot, toot, toot, toot,&mdash;toot, tooooot,&mdash;tooooot&mdash;tooooot&mdash;toot,
toot&mdash;toot, toot.” “Halloo, Sarnia!
Do you get me? Do you hear what I say?”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“Do you hear what I say, Sarnia?”</p>

<p>A third, fourth, and fifth time the message went across,
to receive no response. Then suddenly the operator at
Sarnia heard familiar sounds, and, opening the station door,
he clearly caught the toot, toot of the far-away whistle.
He found a locomotive, and, mounting to the cab, responded
to Edison, and soon messages were tooted back and forth
as freely as though the parted cable were again in operation.</p>

<p>Some years ago the police of New York were mystified
over a murder case. The man they suspected had not fled,
but was still in his usual place, and attending to his business
quite as though nothing had happened to connect him
with the tragedy.</p>

<p>Detectives in plain clothes had been following him and
watching closely his every move in and out of restaurants
and shops and at social affairs; but not the slightest proof
could be secured against him.</p>

<p>One noon-time they followed him into a café, where he
had gone with a friend. The detectives took seats near<span class="pagenum" id="Page200">[200]</span>
him, but each of them sat at different tables in the room
full of people.</p>

<p>When in the café the suspect sat next the wall, a habit
the detectives had noticed. Consequently, only those persons
who sat at one side of him or directly in front could
see his face. During the time they were in the restaurant
the detectives communicated with each other by tapping
on the table tops with a lead-pencil; and something the
man said, which the nearest detective heard, led to the
climax. One detective rose, paid his check, and loitered
near the door; another got up a little later and sauntered
out, but returned with a cardboard sign. Going over to
the table where the suspected criminal and his friend sat,
he deliberately tacked it on the wall above them, then
went out again, leaving the third detective to watch the
face of the man as he read:</p>

<p class="reward">$1000 REWARD<br />
for information leading to the arrest of the murderer of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
on March &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, 1876</p>

<p>The man cast a glance about the restaurant, then said
to his companion: “Did I show any signs of agitation?”
The third detective rose, stepped over to the man, tapped
him on the shoulder, and said, “I want you.” There would
have been a scene of violence had not the other two detectives
closed in on the man, and within six months he
paid the penalty of his crime.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the dot-and-dash alphabet, tapped
out with lead-pencils, the detectives could not have communicated;
but like Edison, they used the means at hand
to open up and carry on a silent conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page201">[201]</span></p>

<h4>Wireless Telegraphy</h4>

<p>Everybody nowadays understands that wireless telegraphy
means the transmission of electrical vibrations through
the ether and earth without the aid of wires or any visible
means of conductivity. The feat of sending an electrical
communication over thousands of miles of wire, or through
submarine cables, is wonderful enough, for all that custom
has made it an every-day miracle. To accomplish this same
end by sending our messages through the apparently empty
air is indeed awe-inspiring and almost beyond belief. And
yet we know that wireless telegraphy is to-day a real scientific
fact.</p>

<p>At first sight it would seem that the instruments must
be complicated and necessarily beyond the ability of the
average boy to make, and far too expensive as well. As a
matter of fact, the young electrician may construct his wireless
apparatus at a very moderate cost, it being understood
that the sending and receiving poles may be mounted on a
housetop or barn.</p>

<p>But first let us consider the theory upon which we are
to work. There is no doubt but that electricity is the highest
known form of vibration&mdash;so high, indeed, that as yet
man has been unable to invent any instrument to record
the number of pulsations per second. This vibration will
occur in, and can be sent through, the ordinary form of conductor,
such as metals, water, fluids and liquids, wet earth,
air and ice. Also through what we call the ether.</p>

<p>Now the ether of the atmosphere, estimated to be fifteen
trillion times lighter than air, is the medium through which<span class="pagenum" id="Page202">[202]</span>
the electrical vibrations pass in travelling in their radial
direction from a central point, corresponding to the ripples
or wavelets formed when a pond or surface of still water
is disturbed. Ether is so fine a substance that the organs
of sense are not delicate enough to detect it, and
it is of such a volatile and uneasy nature that it is
continually in motion. It vibrates under certain conditions,
and when disturbed (as by a dynamo) it undoubtedly
forms the active principle of electricity and magnetism.</p>

<p>James Clark Maxwell believed that magnetism, electricity,
and light are all transmitted by vibrations in one common
ether, and he finally demonstrated his theory by proving
that pulsations of light, electricity, and magnetism differed
only in their wave lengths. In 1887 Professor Hertz succeeded
in establishing proof positive that Maxwell’s theories
were correct, and, after elaborate experiments, he proved
that all these forces used ether as a common medium.
Therefore, if it were not for the ether, wireless telegraphy,
with all its wonders, would not be possible. We understand,
then, that the waves of ether are set in motion from a central
disturbing point, and this can be accomplished only
by means of electrical impulse.</p>

<p>Suppose that we strike a bell held high in the air. The
sound is the result of the vibrations of its mass sending its
pulsating energy through the air. The length of the sound-waves
is measured in the direction in which the waves are
travelling, and if the air is quiet and not disturbed by
wind the sound will travel equally in all directions. The
sound of a bell will not travel so well against a wind as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span>
will with it, just as the ripples on a pond would be checked
by an adverse set of wavelets.</p>

<p>Now the ether can be made to vibrate in a similar manner
to the air by a charge of electricity oscillating or surging
to and fro on a wire several hundred thousand times in
a second. These oscillations strike out and affect the surrounding
ether, so that, according to the intensity of the
disruptive charge at the starting-point, the ether waves
may be made to reach near or distant points.</p>

<p>This is, perhaps, more clearly shown by the action of a
pendulum. In <a href="#FigIX9">Fig. 9</a> the rod and ball are at rest, but if
drawn to one side and released it swings over to the other
side nearly as far away from its central position of rest as
from the starting-point. If allowed to swing to and fro it
will oscillate until at last it will come to rest in a vertical
position. This same oscillation (oscillation being a form of
vibration) takes place in the water when a stone has been
flung into it, and in the ether when affected by the electrical
discharge. In <a href="#FigIX10">Fig. 10</a> are shown the principal varieties of
vibration&mdash;the oscillating, pulsating, and alternating.</p>

<p>It is known that if these oscillations are damped, so that
the over-intense agitation of the central disturbance is
lessened, a new series of vibrations, such as the pulsating or
alternating, is set up, and these secondary vibrations possess
the power to travel around the world&mdash;yes, and perhaps
to other worlds in the planetary cosmos.</p>

<p>The study of ether disturbances, wave currents, oscillating
currents, and the other phenomena dependant upon
this invisible force is most interesting and fascinating, and
were it possible to devote more space to this topic several
chapters could be written on the scientific theory of wireless
telegraphy.<a id="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

For further information on this subject the student is referred to such
well-known books as <i>Signalling Across Space Without Wires</i>, by Prof.
Oliver J. Lodge, and <i>Wireless Telegraphy</i>, by C. H. Sewall.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The principle difference between wire, or line, and wireless
telegraphy is that the overhead wire, or underground or
submarine cable, is omitted. In its stead the ether of the
air is set in vibratory motion by properly constructed instruments,
and the communication is recorded at a distance
by instruments especially designed to receive the transmitted
waves.</p>

<p>It seems to be the popular impression that a wireless message
sent from one point to another travels in a straight
line, as indicated by <a href="#FigIX11">Fig. 11</a>, B representing Boston, which
receives the message from N. Y., or New York. As a matter
of fact, if several sets of wireless receiving instruments
were located on the circumference of a circle the same distance
from New York in all directions, or even at nearer
or farther points, they would all receive the same message.
Instead of travelling in one direction, the ether waves are
set in motion by the electrical disturbance, just as water is
agitated by the stone thrown into it. The ripples, or wavelets,
are started from the central point of disturbance and
radiate out, so that instead of reaching Boston only the
waves travel over every inch of ground, or air space, in all
directions, and would be recorded in every town and village
within the sphere of energy set up by the original force
that put the ether waves in motion. The stronger this
initial force the wider its field of action. This is shown at<span class="pagenum" id="Page206">[206]</span>
<a href="#FigIX12">Fig. 12</a>, which is an area comprising Philadelphia, Pittsburg,
Buffalo, Washington, and other cities. Moreover, the
waves of electrical disturbance would carry far beyond in
all directions, taking in the cities of the north, south, and
west, and at the east, going far out to sea, beyond Boston
harbor and below Cape Hatteras, where ships carrying receiving
instruments could pick up the messages. Like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page207">[207]</span>
ripples on the water, the radiating waves, or rings, become
larger as they reach out farther and farther from the centre
of disturbance, until at last they are imperceptible, and
lose their shape and force.</p>

<p>At great distances, therefore, the ether disturbance becomes
so slight that it is impossible to record the vibration
or message sent out; and until some improved forms of apparatus
and coherer are invented, or the original disturbing
force is enormously increased, it will be impossible to send
messages at longer distances than four or five thousand
miles from a central point. Both Marconi and De Forrest
assert that they are perfecting coherers which will make
it possible to girdle the earth with a message, and that
within the next few years an aerogram may be sent out from
a station, and, after instantly encircling the earth and being
recorded during its passage at all intermediate stations, it
will return and be received at the original sending-point.
This, of course, is a matter of future achievement; but now
that messages across the Atlantic are a commercial fact, it
seems quite possible that the greater feat of overriding space
and reaching any point on the earth’s surface will soon be
a reality. And now to proceed from theory to the construction
of a practical wireless apparatus having a radial
area of action over some ten or fifteen miles.</p>

<p>The principal parts of a wireless apparatus include the
antennas (or receiving and sending poles with their terminal
connections), the induction-coil, strong primary batteries
or dynamo, the coherer and de-coherer, the telegraph
key and sounder (or a telephone receiver), and the necessary
connection wires, binding-posts, and ground-plates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page208">[208]</span></p>

<p>A large induction-coil with many layers of fine insulated
wire will be necessary for the perfect operative outfit. The
most practical coil for the amateur is a Ruhmkorff induction-coil.
(See the directions and illustrations for constructing
this coil, beginning on <a href="#Page59">page 59</a> of <a href="#Page54">chapter iv.</a>)</p>

<p>The sending apparatus is practically the same in all outfits,
and consists of a source of electrical energy, such as
a battery, or dynamo, the essential induction-coil and adjustable
spark-gap between the brass balls on terminal rods,
and the make-and-break switch, or telegraph-key.</p>

<p>It is in the various forms of coherers and receiving apparatus
that the different inventors claim superiority and
originality. The systems also differ in their theory of harmonic
tuning or vibratory sympathy. This is accomplished
by means of coils and condensers, so that the messages
sent out on one set of instruments will not be picked up or
recorded by the receiving apparatus of competitors.</p>

<p>Having made or purchased an induction-coil of proper
and adequate size, it will now be necessary to construct the
parts so that an adjustable spark-gap may be secured.</p>

<p>Make a hollow wooden base for the induction-coil to rest
on. It should be a trifle longer than the length of the coil
and about seven inches wide. This may be made from
wood half an inch thick. The base should be two inches
high, so that it will be easy and convenient to make wire
connections under it. Mount the induction-coil on the
base and make it fast with screws, arranging it so that the
binding-posts are on the side rather than at the top of the
coil, as shown in <a href="#FigIX13">Fig. 13</a>.</p>

<p>Cut a thin board and mount it across the top of the induction-coil<span class="pagenum" id="Page209">[209]</span>
on two short blocks, and to this attach two
double-pole binding-posts (P P). The fine wires from the
induction-coil are made fast to the foot of each post, and
from the posts the aerial wire (A W) and ground wire (G W)
lead out.</p>

<p>Fasten two binding-posts at the forward corners of the
base, and to them make connection-wires fast to the heavy
or primary wires of the coil. Wires B and C lead out from
these posts to the battery and key, and to complete this
part of the sending, or transmitting apparatus it will be
necessary to have two terminal rods and balls attached to
the top of the binding-posts (P P). This part of the apparatus
is generally called the oscillator, and the rods are balanced
on the posts, so that they can be moved in order to
increase or diminish the space (S G), or spark-gap, between
the brass balls.</p>

<p>When, after experiment, the proper space has been determined,
the set screw at the top of the posts will hold
the terminal rods securely in place.</p>

<p>Obtain a piece of brass, copper, or German-silver rod
three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter. Now cut two
short rods, each six inches long, and two inches from one
end flatten the rods with a hammer, as shown at A in <a href="#FigIX14">Fig.
14</a>. Flatten the rod in two places at the other end, as shown
at B B in <a href="#FigIX14">Fig. 14</a>; then bore holes through the flattened
parts (A), so that the binding-screws at the top of the posts
(P P) will pass through them.</p>

<p>Obtain two brass balls from one to one inch and a half
in diameter. If they are solid or cast brass they may be
attached to the ends of the terminal rods by threading, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page210">[210]</span>
that it will be easy to remove them. If the balls are of
spun sheet-metal it will be necessary to solder them fast
to the ends of the rods, and, when polishing the balls, the
rods will have to be removed from the binding-posts. It
is imperative that the balls should be kept polished and in
bright condition at all times, to facilitate the action of the
impulsive sparks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page211">[211]</span></p>

<p>To counterbalance these balls there should be handles at
the long ends of the rods. These handles may be of wood,
or made of composition molded directly on the rods. A
good composition that can be easily made and molded is
composed of eight parts plaster of Paris and two parts of
dextrin made into a thick paste with water. The dextrin
may be purchased at a paint-store, and is the color of light-brown
sugar. Mix the dry plaster and dextrin together,
so that they are homogeneous; then add water to make
the pasty mass. Use an old table-knife to apply the wet
composition to the bars. The flattened parts will help
to hold the mass in place until it sets. It is best to make
two mixtures of the paste and put one on first, leaving it
rough on the surface, so that the last coat will stick to it.
When the last coat is nearly dry it may be rubbed
smooth with the fingers and a little water, or allowed to dry
hard, and then smoothed down with an old file and sand-paper.</p>

<p>If solid brass balls are used for the terminals the composition
handles may be made heavier; but in any event
the proper amount of composition should be used, so that
when the rod is balanced on a nail or piece of wire passed
through the hole it will not tip down at one end or the
other, but will remain in a horizontal position.</p>

<p>The overhead part of the apparatus employed to collect
the electric waves is called the antennæ, and in the various
commercial forms of wireless apparatus this feature differs.
The general principle, however, is the same, and in <a href="#FigIX15">Figs.
15</a>, <a href="#FigIX16">16</a>, <a href="#FigIX17">17</a>,
and <a href="#FigIX18">18</a> some simple forms of construction are
shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page212">[212]</span></p>

<p>Great care must be taken to properly insulate the rod,
wire, or fingers of these antennæ, so that the full force of
the vibration is carried directly down to the coherer and
sounder or receiver. For this purpose, porcelain, glass, or
gutta-percha knobs must be employed.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FigIX15">Fig. 15</a> the apparatus consists of an upright stick, a
cross-stick, and a brace, or bracket, to hold them in proper
place.</p>

<p>Porcelain knobs are made fast to the sticks with linen
string or stout cotton line. Then an insulated copper wire
is run through the holes in the knobs, and from the outer
knob a rod of brass, copper, or German-silver, or even a
piece of galvanized-iron lightning-rod, is suspended. Care
should be taken to see that the joint between rod and wire
is soldered so as to make perfect contact. Otherwise rust
or corrosion will cause imperfect contact of metals, and interrupted
vibrations would be the result. The upright stick
should be ten or fifteen feet high, and may be attached to
a house-top, a chimney, or on the corner of a barn roof.</p>

<p>Another form of single antenna is shown in <a href="#FigIX16">Fig. 16</a>.
This is a rod held fast in a porcelain insulator with cement.
The insulator, in turn, is slipped over the end of a staff, or
pole, which is erected on a building top or out in the open,
the same as a flag-pole. Near the foot of the rod, and just
above the insulator, a conducting-wire is made fast and
soldered. This is run down through porcelain insulators
to the apparatus.</p>

<p>If the pole is erected on a house-top it may be braced with
wires, to stay it, but care must be taken not to have these
wires come into contact with the rod, or conducting-wire.</p>

<p class="caption">TYPES OF ANTENNÆ</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page214">[214]</span></p>

<p>Another form of antennas is shown in <a href="#FigIX17">Fig. 17</a>, where rods
are suspended from a wire which, in turn, is drawn taut
between two insulators. The insulators are held in a
framework composed of two uprights and a cross-piece of
wood.</p>

<p>This frame may be nailed fast to a chimney and to the
gable of a roof, as shown in the <a href="#FigIX17">drawing</a>; and to steady the
rods, so that they will not swing in a high wind, the lower
ends should be tied together with cotton string, the ends of
which should be fastened to the uprights. The leading-in
wire is made fast to the top wire, from which the rods are
suspended, and all the exposed joints should be soldered
to insure perfect contact and conductivity. A modified
form of the Marconi antennæ is shown in <a href="#FigIX18">Fig. 18</a>. This is
made of a metal hoop three of four feet in diameter held in
shape by cross-sticks of wood, which can be lashed fast to
the ring. Leading down from it are numerous copper wires
which terminate in a single wire, the whole apparatus resembling
a funnel. The upper unions where the wires join
the ring need not be soldered, but at the bottom, where they
all come together and join the leading-in wire, it is quite
necessary that a good soldered joint be made. This funnel
may be hung between two upright poles on a house-top, or
suspended from the towers or chimneys.</p>

<p>Almost any metal plate will do for the ground, or the
ground-wire (G W in <a href="#FigIX13">Fig. 13</a>) may be bound to a gas or
water pipe which goes down deep in the ground, where it is
moist. Rust or white lead in the joints of gas-mains sometimes
prevent perfect contact, but in water-pipes the current
will flow readily through either the metal or the water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page215">[215]</span>
To insure the most perfect results, it is best to have an independent
ground composed of metal, and connected directly
with the oscillator, or coherer, by an insulated copper
wire. A simple and easily constructed ground is a sheet
of metal, preferably copper, brass, or zinc, to the upper edge
of which two wires are soldered, as shown in <a href="#FigIX19">Fig. 19</a>. This
is embedded in the ground three or four feet below the surface.
Another ground-plate is a sheet of metal bent in <span class="symbol">V</span>
shape and then inverted. Two wires are soldered to the
angle, and the ends brought together and soldered. This
ground is buried three or four feet deep, and stands in a
vertical position, as shown at <a href="#FigIX20">Fig. 20</a>. At <a href="#FigIX21">Fig. 21</a> a flat
ground is shown. This is a sheet of metal cut with pointed
ends. The ground-wire is soldered to the middle of it, and
it is then buried deep enough to be embedded in moist
earth.</p>

<p>One of the best grounds is an old broiler with a copper
wire soldered to the ends of the handles, as shown at <a href="#FigIX22">Fig.
22</a>. This is buried deep in the ground in a vertical position,
and the insulated copper wire is carried up to the instruments.</p>

<p>The most important part of the wireless telegraphic apparatus
is now to be constructed, and this requires some
care and patience. The coherer is the delicate, sensitive
part of the apparatus on which hinges success or failure.
There are various kinds of coherers designed and used by
different inventors, but while the materials differ and the
construction takes various forms, the same basic principle
applies to all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page217">[217]</span></p>

<p>The coherer can best be explained as a short glass tube
in which iron or other metallic filings are enclosed. Corks
are placed in both ends of the tube, and through these corks
the ends of wire are passed, so that they occupy the position
shown in <a href="#FigIX23">Fig. 23</a>, the ends being separated a quarter of an
inch. Metal filings will not conduct an electric current
the same as a solid rod or bar of the same metal, but resist
the passage of current.</p>

<p>After long periods of experimenting with various devices
to detect the presence of feeble currents, or oscillations,
in the ether, the coherer of metal filings was adopted.
When the oscillations surge through the resonator, the
pressure, or potential, finally breaks down the air film
separating the little particles of metal, and then gently
welds their sharp edges and corners together so as to form
a conductor for the current. Before this process of cohesion
takes place these fine particles offer a very high
resistance to the electrical energy generated by a dry cell
or battery&mdash;so much so that no current is permitted to
pass. But once the oscillations in the ether cause them to
cohere&mdash;presto! the resistance drops from thousands of
ohms to hundreds, and the current from the dry cell now
flows easily through the coherer and deflects the needle
of a galvanometer. This is the common principle of all
coherers of the granulated metal type, although there are
many modifications of the idea.</p>

<p>The action of the electric and oscillatory currents on
particles of metal can best be understood by placing some
fine iron filings on a board, as shown at <a href="#FigIX24">Fig. 24</a>, and
then inserting the aerial and ground wires in the filings,
but separated by an eighth or a quarter of an inch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page218">[218]</span>
A temporary connection may be made as shown in
<a href="#FigIX25">Fig. 25</a>.</p>

<p>A A are aerials on both instruments; C is the open coherer,
or board with iron filings, in which the ends of the
aerial and ground wires are embedded; D C is a dry cell;
and R is a telegraphic relay, or sounder. If the wire across
C was not parted and covered with filings, the dry cell
would operate R, but the high resistance of the particles
of metal holds back the current.</p>

<p>On the opposite side, I C is the induction-coil; K is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page219">[219]</span>
telegraphic key, or switch, which makes and breaks the
current; S B is the storage-batteries, or source of electric
energy; and S G the spark-gap between the brass balls
on the terminal rods. By closing the circuit at K the
current flows through the primary of the induction-coil,
affects the secondary coil, and causes a spark to leap across
the gap between the brass balls. This instantly sets the
ether in motion from A on the right, and the impulse is
picked up by A on the left. This oscillation breaks down
the resistance of the filings at C, and the current from battery,
or dry cell (D C), flows through the filings and operates
the sounder, or relay (R). This operation takes place instantly,
and the particles of metal are seen to cohere, or
shift, so that better contact is established. But as soon
as the spark has jumped across the gap the action of cohesion
ceases until the key (K) is again operated to close the
circuit and cause another spark to leap across the gap.
The shifting of the metal particles on the board (C) is what
takes place in the glass tube of the coherer, <a href="#FigIX23">Fig. 23</a>, but in
this confined space the particles will not drop apart again
as on the flat surface, but will continue to cohere. A de-coherer
is necessary, therefore, to knock the particles apart,
so that the next oscillatory impulse will have a strong and
individual effect. There are several forms of de-coherers
in use, but for the amateur telegrapher an electric-bell
movement without the bell, or, in other words, a buzzer
with a knocker on the armature, will answer every purpose.
(See description of <a href="#Ref002">buzzer</a> on <a href="#Page64">page 64</a>.) It must be properly
mounted, so that on its back stroke, or rebound, the
knocker will strike the glass tube and shake the particles of<span class="pagenum" id="Page220">[220]</span>
metal apart. For this purpose the vibrations of the armature
should be so regulated as to obtain the greatest possible
speed, in order that the dots and dashes (or short and
long periods) will be accurately recorded through the coherer
and made audible by the sounder or telephone receiver.</p>

<p>Another form of coherer is shown in <a href="#FigIX26">Fig. 26</a>. This is
made of a small piece of glass tube, two rods that will accurately
fit in the tube, some nickel filings, two binding-posts,
and a base-block three inches and a half long. The
two binding-posts are mounted on the block, and through
the holes in the body of the posts the rods are slipped.
They pass into the tube, and the blunt ends press the small
mass of filings together, as shown in the drawing. By
means of the binding-posts these coherer-rods may be held
in place and the proper pressure against the filings adjusted;
then maintained by the set-screws. The nickel
filings may be procured by filing the edge of a five-cent
piece. Obtain a few filings from the edge of a dime and
add them to the nickel, so that the mixture will be in the
proportion of one part silver to nine parts nickel. This
mixture will be found to work better than the iron filings
alone. The aerial and ground wires are made fast to the
foot-screws of the binding-posts, and the base on which
the coherer is mounted may be attached to a table or ledge
on which the other parts of the receiving and recording
apparatus are also installed.</p>

<p>Another form of coherer is shown at <a href="#FigIX27">Fig. 27</a>. This is
constructed in a somewhat similar manner to the one just
described. A glass tube is provided with two corks having<span class="pagenum" id="Page221">[221]</span>
holes in them to receive the coherer-rods. Two plugs of
silver are arranged to accurately fit within the tube, and
into these the ends of the coherer-rods are screwed or soldered.
Between these silver plugs, or terminals, the filings
of nickel and silver are placed, and the rods are pushed together
and caught in the binding-posts. The aerial and
ground wires are made fast to the foot-screws of the posts.</p>

<p>For long-distance communication it is necessary to have
a condenser placed in series with the sparking or sending-out
apparatus. (See the type of condenser described and
illustrated in <a href="#Page54">chapter iv.</a>, <a href="#Page72">page 72</a>.)</p>

<p>An astatic galvanometer is also a valuable part of the
receiving apparatus, and the one described on <a href="#Page111">page 111</a>
will show clearly the presence of oscillatory currents by
the rapid and sensitive deflections of the needle.</p>

<p>For local service, where a moderately powerful battery is
employed, a telegraph-key, such as described on <a href="#Page190">page 190</a>,
will answer very well, but for high-tension work, where a
powerful storage-battery or small dynamo is employed, it
will be necessary to have a non-sparking key, so that the
direct current will not form an arc between the terminals
of a key. Most of the keys used for wireless telegraphy have
high insulated pressure-knobs, or the make and break is
done in oil, so that the spark or arc cannot jump or be
formed between the points.</p>

<p>The plan of a simple non-sparking dry switch is shown at
<a href="#FigIX28">Fig. 28</a>. This is built up on a block three inches wide and
five inches long. It consists of a bar (A), two spring interrupters
(B and C), a spring (D), and the binding-posts (E E).
They are arranged as shown in <a href="#FigIX28">Fig. 28</a>, and a front elevation<span class="pagenum" id="Page222">[222]</span>
is given in <a href="#FigIX29">Fig. 29</a>. The strip (B) lies flat on the block, and
is connected with one binding-post by a wire attached under
one screw-head and run along the under side of the base
in a groove to the foot of the post. Strip C is of spring-brass,
and is made fast to the base with screws. This is “dead,” as
no current passes through it, and its only use is to interrupt.
The bar (A) is arranged as explained for the line telegraph-key,
and the remaining binding-post is connected to
it by a wire run under the base and brought up to one of
the angle-pieces forming the hinge. A high wood or porcelain
knob is made fast at the forward end of the bar, so
that when high-tension current is employed the spark will
not jump from the bar to the operator’s hand. The complete
key ready for operation is shown at <a href="#FigIX30">Fig. 30</a>, and to
make it permanent it should be screwed fast to the table,
or cabinet, on which the coil and condenser rest. The plan
of a “wet” key is shown in <a href="#FigIX31">Fig. 31</a>, and the complete key
in <a href="#FigIX32">Fig. 32</a>.</p>

<p>A base of wood three by five inches is made and given
several coats of shellac. Obtain a small rubber or composition
pill or salve box, and make it fast to the front end
of the base with an oval-headed brass screw driven down
through the centre of the box. A wire leading to one binding-post
is arranged to come into contact with the screw,
and the other post is connected by wire to one hinge-plate
supporting the bar. The long machine screw, or rivet,
passed down through the knob and into the bar, extends
down below the bar for half an inch or more, so that when
the knob is pressed down the end of the screw, or rivet, will
strike the top of the screw at the bottom of the box without
the bar coming in contact with the edge of the box.
When in operation the composition box is filled with olive
oil or thin machinery oil, so that when contact is made by
pressing the knob down the circuit will be instantly broken,
the spring at the rear end of the bar drawing it back to rest.
The oil prevents any sparks jumping across; and also breaks
an arc, should one form between the contact-points. With
the addition of a good storage-battery (the strength of which
must be governed by the size of the induction-coil and the
distance the messages are sent) and a dry-cell or two for
the receiving apparatus, the parts of the wireless apparatus
are now ready for assembling. Full directions for making
storage-cells is given in <a href="#Page12">chapter ii.</a>, <a href="#Page21">page 21</a>, and for dry-cells
in chapter ii., <a href="#Page29">page 29</a>. For short-distance work the
plan shown in <a href="#FigIX33">Figs. 33</a> and <a href="#FigIX34">34</a> will be found a very satisfactory
form of apparatus. One of each kind of instrument
should be at every point where communication is to be
established.</p>

<p>In the sending apparatus (<a href="#FigIX33">Fig. 33</a>) S C are the storage-cells,
K the key, and I C the induction-coil. T T are the
terminals and balls, S G the spark-gap, and P P the posts
that hold the terminal rods. A W is the aerial wire running
up from one post, and G W the ground-wire connecting
the other terminal post with the ground-plates.</p>

<p>In the receiving apparatus (<a href="#FigIX34">Fig. 34</a>) C is the coherer,
D C the de-coherer, T S the telegraphic sounder, or relay,
and A G the astatic galvanometer. B is the dry-cell, or
battery, and D C S the de-coherer switch, so that when
the apparatus is not in use the dry-cell will not operate the
buzzer or de-coherer. A W is the aerial wire and G W<span class="pagenum" id="Page225">[225]</span>
the ground-wire. Two or more storage-cells may be connected
in series (that is, the negative of one with the positive
pole of the other) until a sufficiently powerful source
of current is secured for the transmission of messages.</p>

<p>To operate the apparatus, the circuit is closed with K,
and the current from S C flows around the primary coil in<span class="pagenum" id="Page226">[226]</span>
I C and affects the secondary coil, causing the spark to
leap across the gap (S G). This causes a disturbance through
the wires A W and G W, and the ether waves are set in
oscillatory motion from the antennæ on the house-top.
This affects the antennæ at the receiving-point, and the impression
is recorded through the coherer (C) on the telegraphic
sounder or relay (T S), which is operated by the
current from dry-cell or battery (B), since the oscillations
have broken the resistance of the filings in the coherer (C).
The instant that the current passes through the coherer<span class="pagenum" id="Page227">[227]</span>
and operates T S, the astatic galvanometer indicates the
presence of current by the deflected needle.</p>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo227.jpg" alt="Sending apparatus" />

</div><!--container-->

<p>When the apparatus is in operation D C S is closed, so
that the current from B operates the coherer (D C). Directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page228">[228]</span>
communication is broken off, the switch (D C S) should be
opened; otherwise the buzzer would keep up a continuous
tapping. For long-distance work a more efficient sending
apparatus is shown in <a href="#FigIX35">Fig. 35</a>. This is composed of an induction-coil,
with the terminal rods and brass balls forming
the spark-gap, an oil key (K), and three or more large
storage-cells, or a dynamo (if power can be had to run it).
A condenser is placed in connection with the aerial and
ground wires, so that added intensity or higher voltage is
given the spark as it leaps across the gap. In operation
this apparatus is similar to the one already described.
Where contact is made with K the primary coil is charged,
and by induction the current affects the secondary coil, the
current or high voltage from which is stored in the condenser.
When a sufficient quantity is accumulated the
spark leaps across S G and affects wires A W and G W.
This action is almost instantaneous, and directly the impulse
sets the ether in motion the same impulse is recorded
on the distant coherers and sounders.</p>

<p>There are a great many modifications of this apparatus,
but the principles are practically the same, and while the construction
of this apparatus is within the ability of the average
boy, many of the more complicated forms of coherers
and other parts would be beyond his knowledge and skill.
Marconi has realized his ambition to send messages across
the ocean without wires, and is now doing so on a commercial
basis, and at the rate of twenty-five words a minute.
It is but the next step to establish communication half-way
around the world, and finally to girdle the earth.</p>

<span class="chaptitle">DYNAMOS AND MOTORS</span></h3>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">o</span>
adequately treat of dynamos and motors, a good-sized
book rather than this single chapter would be
necessary, and only a general survey of the subject is possible.
Its importance is unquestionable; indeed, the whole
science of applied electricity dates from the invention of
the dynamo. Without mechanical production of electricity
there could be no such thing as electric traction, heat,
light, power, and electro-metallurgy, since the chemical
generation of electricity is far too expensive for commercial
use. Surely it is a part of ordinary education nowadays
to have a clear and definite idea of the principles of
electrical science, and in no department of human knowledge
has there been more constant and rapid advance. It
is only a truism to assert that the school-boy of to-day
knows a hundredfold more about electricity and its varied
phenomena than did the scientists and philosophers of
old&mdash;Volta and Galvani and Benjamin Franklin. Yet it
was for these forerunners to open and blaze the way for
others to follow. A beginning must always be made, and
the Marconis and Edisons of to-day are glad to acknowledge
their indebtedness to the experimenters and inventors of
the past. And now to our subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span></p>

<p>All dynamos are constructed on practically the same
principle&mdash;a field of force rapidly and continuously cutting
another field of force, and so generating electric current.
The common practice in all dynamos and motors is to have
the armature fields revolve within, or cut the forces of the
main fields of the apparatus. There are many different
kinds of dynamos generating as many varieties of current&mdash;currents
with high voltage and low amperage; currents
with low voltage and high amperage; currents direct for
lighting, heating, and power; currents alternating, for high-tension
power or transmission, electro-metallurgy, and other
uses. It is not the intention in this chapter to review all
of these forms, nor to explain the complicated and intricate
systems of winding fields and armatures for special purposes.
Consequently, only a few of the simpler forms of generators
and motors will be here described, leaving the more complex
problems for the consideration of the advanced student.
For his use a list of practical text-books is appended in a
foot-note.<a id="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h4>The Uni-direction Dynamo</h4>

<p>The uni-direction current machine is about the simplest
practicable dynamo that a boy can make. It may be
operated by hand, or can be run by motive power. The
field is a permanent magnet similar to a horseshoe magnet.
This must be made by a blacksmith, but if a large parallel<span class="pagenum" id="Page231">[231]</span>
magnet can be purchased at a reasonable price so much the
better, as time and trouble will be saved. This magnet
should measure ten inches long and four inches and a half
across, with a clear space seven inches long and one inch
and three-quarters wide, inside measure. The metal should
be half an inch thick and one inch and a quarter wide. A
blacksmith will make and temper this magnet form; then,
if there is a power-station near at hand where electricity is
generated for traction or lighting purposes, one of the workmen
will magnetize it for you at a small cost; or it can be
wound with several coils of wire, one over the other, and
a current run through it. When properly magnetized it
should be powerful enough to raise ten pounds of iron.
This may be tested by shutting off the current and trying
its lifting power. If the magnet is too weak to attract the
weight the current should be turned on and another test
made a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Before the steel is tempered there should be four holes
bored in the magnet and countersunk, so that screws may
be passed through it and into the wooden base below, as
shown at <a href="#FigX1">Fig. 1</a>. This wooden base is fourteen inches long,
eight inches wide, and one inch in thickness. It may be
made of pine, white-wood, birch, or any good dry wood that
may be at hand. The blocks on which the magnet rests
are an inch and a quarter square and seven inches long.
The magnet is mounted directly in the middle of the base,
an equal distance from both edges and ends, as shown in the
plan drawing (<a href="#FigX10">Fig. 10</a>). The blocks are attached with glue
and brass screws driven up from the underside of the base.</p>

<p>From a brass strip three-eighths of an inch wide and<span class="pagenum" id="Page232">[232]</span>
one-eighth of an inch thick cut a piece six inches long,
and bore holes at either end through which long, slim, oval-headed
brass screws may pass. Use brass, copper, or German-silver
for this bar, and not iron or steel. To the underside,
and at the middle, solder or screw fast a small block of
brass, through which a hole is to be bored for the spindle
or shaft. This finished bar is shown in <a href="#FigX2">Fig. 2</a>. When
mounted over the magnet and held down with brass screws
driven into the wood base, its end view will appear as
shown in <a href="#FigX3">Fig. 3</a>, A being the bar, B B the screws which hold
it down, D the base into which they are driven, and C C
the blocks under the magnet (N S). The object of this bar
is to support one end of the armature shaft. From brass
one-eighth of an inch thick bend and form two angles, as
shown at <a href="#FigX4">Fig. 4</a>. Two holes for screws are to be drilled in
the part that rests on the base, and one hole, for the shaft
to pass through, is bored near the top of the upright plate.
The centre of this last hole must be the same height from
the base as is the hole in the bar (<a href="#FigX2">Fig. 2</a>) when mounted
over the magnet, as shown at <a href="#FigX3">Fig. 3</a>. The location of these
plates is shown in the plan (<a href="#FigX10">Fig. 10</a>). There is one plate at
each end of the base, as indicated at B and B B, the shaft
passing through the hole in the brass block at the underside
of the bar (C). These angles are the end-bearings for
the armature shaft, and should be accurately centred so
that the armature will be properly centred between the N
and S bars of the magnet.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page234">[234]</span></p>

<p>The armature is made from soft, round iron rod one inch
and a half in diameter and five inches long. A channel is
cut all around it, lengthwise, five-eighths of an inch wide
and half an inch deep, as shown in <a href="#FigX5">Fig. 5</a>. This will have
to be done at a machine-shop in a short bed-planer, since
it would be a long and tedious job to cut it out with a
hack-saw. The sharp corners should be rounded off from
the central lug, so that they will not cut the strands of fine
wire that are to be wound round it.</p>

<p>Two brass disks, or washers, are to be cut, one inch and
a half in diameter and from one-eighth to one-quarter of
an inch thick, for the armature ends. A quarter-inch hole
is to be made in the centre of each for the shaft to fit in, and
two smaller holes must be drilled near the edge, and opposite
each other, so that machine-screws may pass through
them and into holes bored and threaded in the ends of the
armature, as shown at <a href="#FigX5">Fig. 5</a>. These ends will appear as
shown at <a href="#FigX6">Fig. 6</a>, and the middle hole should be threaded so
as to receive the end of a shaft. When the shaft is screwed
in tight the end that passes through the brass disk must
be tapped with a light hammer to rivet the end, and so
insure that the shaft will not unscrew.</p>

<p>The shafts should be of hard brass or of steel. The one
at the front should be one inch and a half in length, and
that at the rear six inches long, measuring from the outer
face of the brass end to the end of the shaft. From boxwood
or maple turn a cylinder three-quarters of an inch in
diameter and an inch long, with a quarter-inch hole through
it. Over this slip a piece of three-quarter-inch brass or
copper tubing that fits snugly, and at opposite sides drill
holes and drive in short screws that will hold the tube fast
to the hub. They must not be so long as to reach the hole
through the centre. Place this hub in a vise, and with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page235">[235]</span>
hack-saw cut the tube across in two opposite places, so
that you will have the cylinder with two half-circular shells
or commutators screwed fast to it, as shown at <a href="#FigX7">Fig. 7</a>.
This hub will fit over the shaft at the front end of the
armature, and will occupy the position shown at F in
<a href="#FigX10">Fig. 10</a>.</p>

<p>Cut two small blocks of wood for the brushes and binding-posts,
and bore a hole through them, so that the foot-screw
of a binding-post may pass through the block and
into the post, as shown at <a href="#FigX8">Fig. 8</a>. From thin spring copper
cut a narrow strip and bend it over the block, catching it at
the top with a screw and lapping it under the binding-post
at the outside.</p>

<p>From boxwood or maple have a small wooden pulley
turned, with a groove in it and a quarter-inch hole through
the centre. This pulley should be half an inch wide and
one inch and a half in diameter, as shown at <a href="#FigX9">Fig. 9</a>. This
is to be attached at the end of the long shaft, where it will
occupy the position shown at E in <a href="#FigX10">Fig. 10</a>.</p>

<p>All the parts are now ready for assembling except the
armature, which must be wound. Before laying on the
turns of wire the channel in the iron must be lined with
silk, held in place with glue or shellac. A band of silk
ribbon is given two turns about the centre of the iron, and
the sides are so completely covered with silk that not a
single strand of wire will come into direct contact with the
iron. Great care must be taken, when winding on the
wire, not to kink, chafe, or part the strands. The channel
should be filled but not overcrowded, and when full several
wraps of insulating tape should be made fast about the
armature to hold the wire firmly in place and prevent it
from working out at the centre when the armature is driven
at high speed. The armature, when properly wound and
wrapped, will appear as shown at A in <a href="#FigX11">Fig. 11</a>, and it is
then ready to have the ends screwed on. Several sizes of
wire may be used to wind the armature, according to the
current desired, but for general use it would be well to use
No. 30 silk-insulated copper wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page237">[237]</span></p>

<p>About four ounces should be enough for this armature,
and the ends are to be passed through small holes in the
brass end (B); see <a href="#FigX11">Fig. 11</a>. One end must be soldered to
one commutator, the other end to the other commutator.
The end-piece (B) is attached to the iron armature (A) with
machine-screws; then C is to be made fast in a similar
manner.</p>

<p>When putting the parts together, it would be well to use
some shellac on the wooden cylinder and driving-wheel to
make them hold to the shaft.</p>

<p>By following the plan in <a href="#FigX10">Fig. 10</a>, it will be an easy matter
to put the parts together; when they are assembled the
complete machine will appear as shown in the drawing
(<a href="#FigX12">Fig. 12</a>).</p>

<p>The driving-wheel should be of wood five-eighths of an
inch thick and six inches in diameter, and held in the frame
of wood and metal brackets by a bolt. A short handle can
be arranged with which to turn the wheel, and a small
leather belt will transmit the power to the small wheel on
the armature shaft. As the armature is revolved the lines
of force are cut and the current is carried out through the
wire attached to the binding-posts on the blocks (G G).</p>

<p>Considerable current may be generated if the armature
is driven at higher speed than the hand-wheel will cause it
to revolve. This can be accomplished by running the belt
over a larger wheel, such as the fly-wheel of a sewing-machine,
or connecting it to a large pulley on a water-motor.
The latter may be attached to a faucet in the wash-tub if
there is pressure enough to do the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page239">[239]</span></p>

<h4>A Small Dynamo</h4>

<p>All dynamos are constructed on the same general principle
as that of the uni-direction machine just described;
but they differ in their windings, the quantities of metal
electrified, the sizes and lengths of wire wound on both
armature and field, and in their shape and speeds.</p>

<p>In large dynamos it is impossible to employ steel magnets
of the required size. In place of them soft iron cores
are used and magnetized by external electric current; or
the wiring is done in “series” or “shunt,” so that the fields
will be self-exciting once the machine has been properly
started.</p>

<p>The principal difference in dynamos is, perhaps, more
clearly illustrated by the diagrams shown in <a href="#FigX13">Figs. 13</a>, <a href="#FigX14">14</a>,
<a href="#FigX15">15</a>, and <a href="#FigX16">16</a>. In <a href="#FigX13">Fig. 13</a> the arrangement of armature and
field-magnet is the same as in the uni-direction machine,
the field (F) being of magnetized steel, while the armature
(A) is of soft iron wound with coils of fine wire, the ends
of which are brought out at the commutators (C), through
which the current is carried to the brushes (B and B B). If,
however, the soft iron cores are used, a separate magnetizing
electric current must be passed through the coils of wire
wound about the field-pieces, so that they will become temporary
magnets&mdash;the same as the cores of an electric bell
movement, a telegraph-sounder, or the induction-coil core
when a current is passed through the primary coil. The
armature (A) is then driven at high speed by power, and
the current is taken off for use through wires that lead
from B and B B.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page240">[240]</span></p>

<p>In all of these figures the armatures rotate, in the space
between the large pole-pieces of the field-magnets, in the
same direction as the hands of a clock move. In these figure
drawings the field-magnets, commutators, and brushes
only are shown, the armature being indicated by the circle
(A).</p>

<p><a href="#FigX13">Figure 13</a> represents a dynamo, the field-magnets of
which are excited by a separate battery or generator.
This is known as a “separately excited” machine, and is
employed for various uses. The brushes (B and B B) are
connected to the external circuit&mdash;that is, with the motor
or other apparatus for which current is to be generated.
The magnetic field in which the armature rotates will be
constant if the exciting current is constant, like the magnetism
in the magnet of the uni-direction current machine.</p>

<p>The induced electro-motive force (which depends upon
the rate at which the lines of force are cut) will be constant
for the given speed at which the armature rotates. This
action is the same as that described for the uni-direction
current machine.</p>

<p><a href="#FigX14">Figure 14</a> is the diagram of a “series”-wound dynamo.
The field and armature are soft gray iron, and are wound
in series&mdash;that is, one end of the magnet-winding is made
fast to the brush B, the other to the brush B B, and the
apparatus to be operated by the current is let in between
B B and the magnet, as shown by the indicated electric arc-light
in the illustration. The field-magnet coils, the armature,
and the external conductors are in series with each
other, forming a simple circuit. When the armature is
driven at high speed the field-magnets become self-exciting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page241">[241]</span>
with the result that current is generated. Its simple course
is through B B to commutators on the hub, thence through
one winding on the iron armature A, to B, through field
F, and back to B B again, operating in its course any pieces
of equipment designed for electric impulse, such as motors,
or lamps, trolley-cars, trains, or electric machinery.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The third type, shown in <a href="#FigX15">Fig. 15</a>, is known as “shunt”-winding.
The field-magnet coils and the external resistance
are in parallel, or shunt with each other, instead of in
series. The brushes are connected with the external circuit,
and also with the ends of the field-magnet coils. This
is clearly shown in the drawing. The ends of the field-coils
are connected with brushes B and B B, and the external
circuit wires are connected also with the same brushes,
and pass down to such an apparatus as a plating bath, in
which the current runs through the electrode, the electrolyte,
and the cathode, most of the current generated passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page242">[242]</span>
through the external circuit. The field-coils are of fine wire,
and when the armature is rotated there will always be a
current through the field-magnets, whether the external
circuit is complete or not. If a break occurs in the external
circuit, a more powerful current will consequently pass
through the field-magnets.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FigX16">Fig. 16</a> a “compound”-wound dynamo is shown. It is
a combination of the series and the shunt machine. The
field-magnet coils are composed of two sizes of wire. There
are comparatively four turns of stout wire and many turns
of fine wire, the ends of both being connected, as shown in
the drawing. The stout wire leads out to lamps which are
arranged in series, as shown at the foot of the drawing.
The current developed by this dynamo is one of “constant
potential,” and is used almost exclusively for incandescent
lamps, the “constant” current from the series-wound machine
being used for arc-lamps, power, and other commercial
purposes.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to use the first or last systems, nor
to experiment with the alternating current, with its phases
and cycles. All that a boy wants is a good direct-current
machine that will light lamps, run sewing-machines or motors,
and furnish the power for long-distance wireless telegraphy
and other apparatus requiring considerable current.</p>

<p>To begin with, it would be better to make a small dynamo
and study its principles as you progress; then it will be a
great deal easier to construct a larger one. It will be necessary
to have the iron parts made at a blacksmith-shop,
since the various cutting, threading, and tapping operations
call for the use of special iron-working tools. Soft iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page243">[243]</span>
should be used, and if a piece of cast-iron can be procured
for the lugs or magnet ends it will give better service than
wrought-iron.</p>

<p>From three-quarter-inch round iron cut two cores, each
three inches and a half long, and thread them at both ends,
as shown at B B in <a href="#FigX17">Fig. 17</a>. From band-iron five-eighths
of an inch thick and one inch and a half wide cut a yoke (A),
and bore the indicated holes two inches and three-quarters
apart, centre to centre. These should be threaded so that
the cores (B B) will screw into them. From a bar of iron
cut off two blocks one inch and a half by one inch and a
half by two inches for the lugs. Now, with a hack-saw
and a half-round file, cut out one side of each lug, as shown
at C. These lugs are to be bored and threaded at one end,
so that they can be screwed on the lower ends of the cores
(C C).</p>

<p>For a larger dynamo the yoke should be made six inches
long, one inch thick, and two inches and a half wide. The
cores should be of one-inch iron pipe. These will be hollow,
as shown at B B in <a href="#FigX18">Fig. 18</a>. For the ends cast-iron blocks
must be made or cast from a pattern two inches and three-quarters
square and four inches high, as shown at C. The
yoke (A) and the lugs (C) are bored and threaded to receive
the one-inch pipe, and when set up this will constitute an
iron field-magnet six inches wide, two inches thick, and
nine inches high. This, if properly wound, should develop
a quarter of a horse-power.</p>

<p>The parts shown in <a href="#FigX17">Fig. 17</a>, when screwed together, will
give you a field-magnet two by one and a half by five and
three-quarter inches high, and will appear as shown in <a href="#FigX19">Fig.
19</a>, A being the yoke at the top, B B the cores, C C the
lugs, and D a strip of brass screwed fast across the back of
the lugs (C C), and in which a hole is bored to act as a bearing
for one end of the armature shaft. Between the lugs
and the strip (D) fibre washers three-eighths of an inch in
thickness are placed to keep the strip away from the lugs.
A hole is bored directly through the middle of each lug,
from front to rear, and it is threaded at each end so that
a machine-screw will fit in it. The brass strip (D) is five-eighths
of an inch wide, three-sixteenths of an inch thick,
and four inches long. Copper or German-silver may be
used in place of brass, but iron or steel must not be employed,
since these metals are susceptible to magnetism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page245">[245]</span>
Two holes should be made in the bottom of each lug, and
threaded, so that machine-screws may be passed through a
wooden base and into them in order to hold the dynamo on
the base.</p>

<p><a href="#FigX20">Figure 20</a> is an end view of the field-magnets showing the
yoke at A, the core at B, the lug at C, and the bearing and
binding-strip of yellow metal at D. Two blocks of hard-wood,
an inch square and one inch and a half long, are cut
and provided with holes, so that they can be fastened to the
lugs C C with long, slim machine-screws, as shown at E E
in <a href="#FigX21">Fig. 21</a>. This is a view looking down on the magnets,
blocks, and straps. These blocks are to support the brushes
and terminals, and should be linked across the face with a
brass strap G, so that the other end of the armature shaft
may be supported. Care must be taken, when setting straps
D and G, to have them line. The holes, too, must be centred,
since the armature must revolve accurately within
the field-lugs (C C) without touching them, and there is but
one-sixteenth of an inch space between them.</p>

<p>From hard-wood half an inch in thickness cut a base,
six by seven inches, and two strips an inch wide and five
inches long. With glue and screws driven up from the
underside of the strips fasten them to the base, as shown
at <a href="#FigX22">Fig. 22</a>. Then make the field-magnets fast to the base
with long machine-screws, using washers under the heads
at the underside of the base-board. The mounting should
then appear as shown in <a href="#FigX28">Fig. 28</a>.</p>

<p>From steel, half an inch in diameter, cut a shaft five
inches long. Have it turned down smaller at one end for
three-eighths of an inch, and at the other end for a distance
of one inch and a half, as shown at <a href="#FigX23">Fig. 23</a>. This is for the
armature, and it should fit between D and G in <a href="#FigX21">Fig. 21</a>,
and should revolve easily in the holes cut to receive it in
both straps, with not more than one-eighth of an inch
play forward or backward. The long, projecting end should<span class="pagenum" id="Page247">[247]</span>
be at the rear, and should extend beyond strip D for three-quarters
of an inch, so that the driving-pulley can be made
fast to it.</p>

<p>The armature is made up of segments or laminations of
soft iron and insulated copper wire. The laminated armature
works much better than does the solid metal ring or
lug, and a pattern may be made from a piece of tin from
which all the sections can be cut. With a compass, strike a
two-inch circle on a clear piece of tin; then mark it off, as
shown at <a href="#FigX24">Fig. 24</a>, and cut it out with shears. The hole at
the centre of the pattern need not be bored, but a small
pinhole should be made so that a centre-punch can be used
to indicate the middle of each plate for subsequent perforation.
Ordinary soft band iron may be employed for
this purpose, and the sections should not be more than one-sixteenth
of an inch in thickness.</p>

<p>It will take some time to cut out the required number of
pieces for this small armature. When they are all ready
they should be slipped over the shaft, and if they have been
properly matched and cut, they should appear as a solid
body, one inch and a half long.</p>

<p>Arrange these laminations on the armature shaft so that
when the shaft is in position the mass of iron will be within
the lugs of the field-magnets. The holes through the iron
plate should be so snug as to call for some driving to put
them in place. Each disk of iron should be given a coat of
shellac to insulate it, and between each piece there should
be a thin cardboard or stout paper separator to keep the
disks apart. These paper washers should be dipped in hot
paraffine, or thick shellac may be used to obtain a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page248">[248]</span>
sticking effect and so solidify the laminations into a compact
mass. When this operation is completed the armature
core should appear as shown in <a href="#FigX25">Fig. 25</a>.</p>

<p>From maple, or other hard-wood with a close grain, make
a cylinder three-quarters of an inch long and one inch in
diameter to fit the shaft. Over this drive a piece of copper
or brass tubing, and at four equal distances, near the rear<span class="pagenum" id="Page249">[249]</span>
or inner edge, make holes and drive small, round-headed
screws into the wood. Then, with a hack-saw, cut the tube
into four equal parts between the screws. This is the
commutator. In order to hold the quarter circular plates
fast to the cylinder, remove one screw at a time, and place
thick shellac on the cylinder. Then press the plate firmly
into place and reset the screw. Repeat this with the other
three, and the armature will be ready for the winding.</p>

<p>The voltage and amperage of a dynamo is reckoned by
its windings, the size of wire, the number of turns, and the
direction. This is a matter of figuring, and need not now
concern the young electrician, since it is a technical and
theoretical subject that may be studied later on in more
advanced text-books.</p>

<p>For this dynamo use No. 22 cotton-insulated copper wire
for the armature, and No. 16 double cotton-insulated copper
wire for the field. The armature, when properly wound
and ready for assembling with the brushes and wiring, will
appear as shown in <a href="#FigX26">Fig. 26</a>.</p>

<p>A small driving-wheel two inches in diameter and half
an inch thick must now be turned from brass and provided
with a V-shaped groove on its face. The hub, at one side,
is fitted with a set-screw, so that it can be bound tightly on
the shaft. This pulley is made fast to the shaft at the rear
of the dynamo, and on the opposite end to where the commutator
hub is attached.</p>

<p>A diagram of the wiring is shown in <a href="#FigX29">Fig. 29</a>, and in <a href="#FigX30">Fig.
30</a> the mode of attaching the ends of the coil wires to the
commutators is indicated. Two complete coils of wire
must be made about each channel of the armature, as illustrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page250">[250]</span>
on the drum of <a href="#FigX30">Fig. 30</a>. These are separated by a
strip of cardboard dipped in paraffine and placed at the
centre of a channel while the winding is going on. In some
armatures the coils are laid one over the other; but with
this construction, and in the case of a short-circuit, a broken
wire, or a burn-out, it is impossible to reach the under coil
without removing the good one.</p>

<p>Begin by attaching one end of the fine insulated wire to
commutator No. 1; then half fill the channel, winding the
wire about the armature, as indicated in <a href="#FigX30">Fig. 30</a>. When
the required number of turns has been made, carry the end
around the screw in commutator No. 2, baring the wire to
insure perfect contact when caught under the screw-head.
From No. 2 carry the wire around through the channel at
right angles to the first one, and after half filling it bring
the end out to commutator No. 3. Carry the wire in again
and fill up the other half of the first channel, and bring the
end out to commutator No. 4. Fill up the remaining half
of the second channel; then attach the final end to commutator
No. 1, and the armature winding will be complete
without having once broken the strand of wire.</p>

<p>To keep the coils of wire in place, and to prevent them
from flying out, under the centrifugal force of high speed,
it would be well to bind the middle of the armature with
wires or adhesive tape.</p>

<p>After driving down the small screws over the leading-in
and leading-out wires the armature will be ready to
mount in the bearings. As the blocks that support the
brushes and binding-posts partly close the opening to
the cavity at the front, the armature will have to be inserted<span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span>
from the back into the strip (G) in <a href="#FigX21">Fig. 21</a>. Then
the back strip (D) is screwed in place. The armature, when
properly mounted, should revolve freely and easily within
the field-lugs without friction, and the lugs must by no
means touch the armature. From thin spring-copper
brushes may be cut and mounted on the block under the
binding-posts, so that one will rest on top of the commutators
while the other presses up against the underside. The
wiring is then to be placed on the field-magnets. This is
carried out as described for the electric magnets on <a href="#Page54">pages
54-58</a> of chapter iv., each core receiving five or seven layers,
or as much as it will hold without overlapping the lug or
yoke. The ends of the wires are connected as shown at
<a href="#FigX14">Fig. 14</a> or <a href="#FigX15">Fig. 15</a>, the ends being carried down through the
base and up again in the right location to meet the foot of
a binding-post. The complete dynamo will appear as
shown in <a href="#FigX28">Fig. 28</a>.</p>

<p>Before the dynamo is started for the first time it would
be well to run a strong current through the field coils.
The residual magnetism retained by the cores and iron parts
will then be ready for the next impulse when the dynamo
is started again. Larger dynamos may be made of this
type. With an armature, the core of which is four inches
in diameter and six inches long, having eight instead of
four channels, and placed within a field of proportionate
size, the dynamo will develop one horse-power.</p>

<h4>A Split-ring Dynamo</h4>

<p>Another type of dynamo is shown in <a href="#FigX31">Fig. 31</a>. This is
composed of a wrought or cast iron split-ring wound for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page252">[252]</span>
field, an armature made up of laminations, and the necessary
brushes, posts, commutators, and wire.</p>

<p>Have a blacksmith shape an open ring of iron, in the form
of a C, three-eighths of an inch thick and four inches wide.
The opening should be three inches wide, as shown in <a href="#FigX32">Fig.
32</a>. This ring should measure five inches on its outside
diameter, and the ends are to be bored and threaded to<span class="pagenum" id="Page253">[253]</span>
receive machine-screws. Two lugs are to be made from
wrought-iron to fit on these ends. These should be four
inches long, an inch and a half high, and three-quarters of
an inch thick at top and bottom. They should be hollowed
out at the middle, so that an armature two inches in diameter
will have one-eighth of an inch play all around
when arranged to revolve within them. Holes are made
through the lugs to receive machine-screws, which are driven
into the holes in the ends of the iron (C). Wrought-iron L
pieces are made one inch and a half high and an inch across
the bottom, and with machine-screws they are made fast to
the backs of the lugs to act as feet on which the field-magnet
may rest, as shown in <a href="#FigX33">Fig. 33</a>. Across the back of the
lugs, and set away from them by fibre washers, a strap of
brass is made fast. This measures three-quarters of an
inch wide and a quarter of an inch thick, and at the middle
of it a three-eighth-inch hole is bored to receive the rear
end of the armature shaft. This is shown in <a href="#FigX34">Fig. 34</a>, which
is a front view of the field, or C, iron, the lugs (L L) and
feet (F F), the armature bearing (S), and the base (B), of three-quarter-inch
hard-wood. The field-magnet is bolted to the
base with lag-screws, so that it will be held securely in place.</p>

<p>The laminations for the armature core are two inches in
diameter, and are cut from soft iron one-sixteenth of an
inch thick. They have eight channels, as shown in <a href="#FigX35">Fig. 35</a>,
and the tubing on the commutator hub is divided into four
parts so that the terminals from each coil can be brought
to a commutator, as described for <a href="#FigX30">Fig. 30</a>. In the eight-channel
armature, however, there is but one coil of wire in
each channel.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FigX36">Fig. 36</a> a plan of the armature is shown, S representing
the shaft, B B the bearings, L the laminations, C the commutators
and hub, P the driving-pulley, and N N the nuts
that hold the laminations together and lock them to the
shaft. The shaft is half an inch in diameter, the laminations
four inches thick, and the commutator barrel one inch
in diameter and three-quarters of an inch long. The shaft
is turned down from the middle to where P and C are attached;
then at the front end it is made smaller, where it
passes through the front bearing.</p>

<p>With the detailed description already given for the construction
of the small dynamo, it should be an easy matter
to carry out the work on this one, and a quarter horse-power
generator should be the result. The field-magnet is wound
with five or seven layers of No. 16 double cotton-insulated
wire, and the armature with No. 22 silk or cotton-covered
wire. The connections may be made for either the series
or the shunt windings shown in <a href="#FigX14">Figs. 14 and 15</a>. Another
type of field is shown in <a href="#FigX37">Fig. 37</a>, where two plates of iron are
screwed to one core, and the lugs are, in turn, made fast to
the inner sides of the plates within which the armature revolves.
The “Manchester” type is shown in <a href="#FigX38">Fig. 38</a>, where
two cores, constructed by a top and bottom yoke, are excited
by the coils, and the lugs are arranged between the
cores, so that the armature revolves within them.</p>

<h4>A Small Motor</h4>

<p>The shapes, types, powers, and forms of motors are as
varied and different as those of dynamos, each inventor<span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span>
designing a different type and claiming superiority. The
one common principle, however, is the same&mdash;that of an
armature revolving within a field, and lines of force cutting
lines of force. A motor is the reverse of a dynamo. Instead
of generating current to develop power or light, a
current must be run through a motor to obtain power.</p>

<p>Motors are divided into two classes: the D C, or direct
current, and the A C, or alternating current. For the
amateur the direct-current motor will meet every requirement,
and since the battery, or dynamo current, that may
be available to run a motor, is in all probability a direct
one, it will be necessary to construct a motor that is adapted
to this source of power and for the present avoid the complications
of the alternating current both in generation and
in use.</p>

<p>The direct-current motor is an electrical machine driven
by direct current, the latter being generated in any desired
way. This current is forced through the machine by electro-motive
force, or voltage; the higher the pressure, or voltage,
the more efficient the machine. Be careful lest too much
current (amperage) is allowed to flow, for the heat developed
thereby will burn out the wiring.</p>

<p>Motors are so constructed that when a current is passed
through the field and armature coils the armature is rotated.
The speed of the armature is regulated by the
amount of amperage and voltage that passes through the
series of magnets, and this rotating power is called the
torque.</p>

<p>Torque is a twisting or turning force, and when a pulley
is made fast to the armature shaft, and belted to connect<span class="pagenum" id="Page257">[257]</span>
with machinery, this torque, or force, is employed for
work.</p>

<p>The speed of an armature when at full work is usually
from twelve hundred to two thousand revolutions a minute.
As few machines are designed to work at that velocity, a
system of speeding down with back gears, or counter-shafts
and pulleys, is employed. The motor itself cannot be slowed
down without losing power. The efficiency of motors is due
to the centrifugal motion of the mass of iron and wire in the
armature and the momentum it develops when spurred on
by the magnetism of the field-magnets acting upon certain
electrified sections of the armature. The armature of a
working motor is usually of such high resistance that the
current employed to run it would heat and burn out the
wires if the full force of the current was permitted to flow
through it for any length of time. As the armature rotates
it has counter electro-motive force impressed upon it. This
acts like resistance, and reduces the current passing through.
The higher the speed the less current it takes, so that after
a motor has attained its highest, or normal speed, it is using
less than half the current required to start it.</p>

<p>Reduction of current in the armature reduces torque, so
that the turning force of the armature is reduced as its
speed of rotation increases. On the other hand, the momentum,
or “throw,” produces power at high speed, together
with an actual saving of current. An armature revolving
at sixteen hundred revolutions, and giving half a
horse-power on a current of five amperes, is more economical
than one making three to five hundred revolutions, and
giving half a horse-power on a current of fifteen to twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span>
amperes. Thus, a slowly turning armature takes more current
and exerts higher torque than a rapidly rotating one.</p>

<p>To protect the fine wire on the armature from burning,
in high-voltage machines a starting-box, or rheostat, is employed.
The motor begins working on a reduced current,
and as it picks up speed more current is let in, and so on
until the full force of the current is flowing through the
motor. It is then turning fast enough to protect itself
through the counter electro-motive force. This can be
understood better after some practical experience has been
had in the construction and running of motors. Of the
various forms of motors but three will be illustrated and
described; but the boy with ideas can readily design and
construct other types as he comes to need them.</p>

<h4>The Flat-bed Motor</h4>

<p>The simplest of all motors is the flat-bed type, illustrated
in <a href="#FigX39">Fig. 39</a>. This is composed of a magnet on a shaft revolving
before a fixed magnet attached to the upright board
of the base. Where space is no object, this motor will
develop considerable power from a number of dry-cells or
a storage-battery. Now, in the section relating to dynamos,
four different systems of wiring were shown. In
motors of the direct-current type but one system will be
described&mdash;that of the series-winding, illustrated in <a href="#FigX40">Fig. 40</a>.
The current, entering at A, passes to the brush (B), thence
through the commutator (C) and the armature coils. It
runs on through the brush (B B), the field-coils (F), and out
at D. This is the same course the current takes in the
series-wound dynamo illustrated in <a href="#FigX14">Fig. 14</a>, page 241, and
with such a dynamo current could be generated to run any
series-wound, direct-current motor.</p>

<p>From hard-wood half an inch thick cut a base-piece six
inches and a half long by three inches and a half wide.
Arrange this base on cross-strips three-quarters of an inch
wide and half an inch thick, making the union with glue
and screws driven up from the underside. To one end of
this base attach an upright or back two inches and three-quarters
high, and allow the lower edge to extend down to
the bottom of the cross-strip, as shown at the left of <a href="#FigX39">Fig.
39</a>. Make this fast to the end of the base and side of the
cross-strip with glue and screws; then give the wood a
coat of stain and shellac to properly finish it.</p>

<p>Now have a blacksmith make two <span class="symbol">U</span> pieces of soft iron
for the field and armature cores, as shown in <a href="#FigX41">Fig. 41</a>. These
are of quarter-inch iron one inch and a half in width.
They are one inch and three-quarters across and the same
in length. One of them should have a half-inch hole bored
in the end (at the middle), and above and below it smaller
holes for round-headed screws to pass through. By means
of these screws the <span class="symbol">U</span> is held to the wooden back. The
other <span class="symbol">U</span> is to have a three-eighth-inch hole bored in it so
that it will fit on the armature shaft. Wind the <span class="symbol">U</span> irons
with six layers of No. 20 cotton-insulated wire, having first
covered the bare iron with several wraps of paper. Use
thick shellac freely after each layer is on, so that the turns
of wire will be well insulated and bound to each other.
Follow the wiring diagram shown in <a href="#FigX40">Fig. 40</a> when winding
these cores, and when the field is ready, make it fast to<span class="pagenum" id="Page261">[261]</span>

screws.</p>

<p>Directly in the middle of the hole through the field iron
bore a quarter-inch hole for the armature shaft to pass
through; then make an <span class="symbol">L</span> piece, of brass, two inches high,
three-quarters of an inch wide, and with the foot an inch
long, as shown at <a href="#FigX42">Fig. 42</a>. Two holes are made in the foot
through which screws will pass into the base, and near the
top a quarter-inch hole is to be bored, the centre of which
is to line with that through the back, at the middle of the
field core. The shaft is made from steel three-eighths of an
inch in diameter and six inches and a half long. One inch
from one end the shaft should be turned down to a quarter
of an inch in diameter, and one inch and a quarter from the
other end it must be reduced to a similar size. The short
end mounts in the back and the long one receives the pulley,
after the latter passes through the <span class="symbol">L</span> bearing. A piece of
three-eighth-inch brass tubing an inch long is slipped over
the shaft two inches from the pulley end and secured with
a flush set-screw. This tubing is then threaded and provided
with two nuts, one at either end, so that when the
armature <span class="symbol">U</span> is slipped on the collar the nuts can be tightened
and made to hold the magnet securely on the shaft. This
shaft is clearly shown in the sectional drawings <a href="#FigX43">Fig. 43</a>.</p>

<p>At the left side the shaft (S) passes into the wood back
through the quarter-inch hole. At the outside a brass
plate with a quarter-inch hole is screwed fast and acts as
a bearing. The shaft does not touch the field-magnet
(F M), because the hole is large enough for the quarter-inch
shaft to clear it. A fibre washer (F W) is placed on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span>
shaft before it is slipped through the back. This prevents
the shaft from playing too much, and deadens any sound of
“jumping” while rotating.</p>

<p>At the middle the shaft (S) passes through the brass collar
on which the threads are cut. A M represents the armature
magnet, and W W the washers and nuts employed to
bind it in place. At the right, S again represents the shaft,
B the bearing, C the commutator hub, and P the pulley,
while R is the small block under the hub to which the
brushes and binding-posts are attached.</p>

<p>From the descriptions already given of dynamos, and
with these figure drawings as a guide, it should be an easy
matter to assemble this motor.</p>

<p>The ends of the field and armature magnets should be
separated an eighth of an inch. The hub for the commutators
is three-quarters of an inch long and three-quarters
of an inch in diameter. The commutators are made as described
for the uni-direction current machine, care being
taken to keep the holding screws from touching the shaft.
A three-quarter-inch cube of wood is mounted on the base,
under the commutator hub, and to this the brushes and
binding-posts are made fast, as shown in <a href="#FigX39">Fig. 39</a>. Unless
the armature happens to be in a certain position this motor
is not self-starting, but a twist on the pulley, as the current
is turned on, will give it the necessary start. Its speed will
then depend on the amount of current forced through the
coils.</p>

<h4>Another Simple Motor</h4>

<p>Another type of motor is shown in <a href="#FigX44">Fig. 44</a>, where one
field-winding magnetizes both the core and the lugs. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page263">[263]</span>
frame of this motor is made up of two plates of soft iron a
quarter of an inch thick, six inches long, and two inches and
a half wide. Each plate is bent at one end so as to form
a foot three-quarters of an inch long, and a half-inch hole is
drilled one inch and a quarter up from the bottom, at the
middle of each plate. Through this hole pass the machine-screws
which hold the iron core in place between the side-plates.
The core is made of three-quarter-inch round iron
two inches and three-quarters long, and drilled and threaded
at each end to receive the binding machine-screws.</p>

<p>Two lugs are cut from iron, and hollowed at one side so
that an armature two inches in diameter will rotate within
them when made fast to the side-plates. The lugs are two
inches and a half long, an inch wide, and two inches and a
half high.</p>

<p>From iron five-eighths of an inch wide and one-eighth of
an inch thick make two side-strips with <span class="symbol">L</span> ends. These are
four inches long, and are provided with two holes so that
the machine-screws which hold the lugs to the inside plates
will also hold these strips in place, at the outside, as shown
in <a href="#FigX45">Fig. 45</a>. At the rear these strips extend half an inch
beyond the frame. Across the back a brass strip of the
same size as the iron strips is arranged. It is held at the
ends by screws, or small bolts, made fast to the <span class="symbol">L</span> ends of
the side-strips. Directly in the middle of the back-strip a
hole is made for the armature shaft, and beyond it the pulley
is keyed or screwed fast to the shaft.</p>

<p>At the front a similar strip is made and attached. This
latter has a small hole in the middle of it to serve as a bearing
for the forward end of the shaft. Across the top of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page264">[264]</span>
motor a brass strip or band is made fast with machine-screws;
and at the angles formed by the front ends of the side-strips
and the front cross-strips hard-wood blocks are attached.
To these the brushes and binding-posts are made fast, so
that one brush at the top of the left-hand block rests on
the top of the commutator. The one at the underside of
the opposite block must rest on the underside of the commutator.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The armature core is made up of laminations as described
for the dynamo armatures. In a really efficient motor the
armature should have eight or more channels.</p>

<p>The other parts of the motor may be assembled and
wired as described on the preceding pages. The armature
should be wound with No. 20 or 22 insulated copper wire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page265">[265]</span>
and the field with No. 16 or 18. For high voltage, however,
the armature should be wound with finer wire and a rheostat
used to start it.</p>

<h4>A Third Type of Motor</h4>

<p>The third type is but a duplicate of the series-wound
dynamo, the general plan of which is shown in <a href="#FigX40">Fig. 40</a>.</p>

<p>This motor can be made any size, but as its dimensions
are increased the weight of the field-magnets and armature
must be proportionately enlarged. For an efficient
and powerful motor, the field should stand ten inches high
and six inches broad. The iron cores are five inches long
and one inch and a half in diameter. These should be made
by a blacksmith and bolted together. The armature is three
inches in diameter and four inches long, and should develop
two-thirds of a horse-power when sufficient current is running
through the coils to drive it at sixteen hundred revolutions.</p>

<p>The wiring is carried out as shown in <a href="#FigX40">Fig. 40</a>, and the
armature hung and wound as suggested for the dynamo
shown in <a href="#FigX28">Fig. 28</a>, <a href="#Page246">page 246</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter XI<br />
<span class="chaptitle">GALVANISM AND ELECTRO-PLATING</span></h3>

<h4>Simple Electro-plating</h4>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">o</span>
the average boy experimenter, electro-plating is one
of the most fascinating of the uses to which electricity
may be put. In scientific language the process is known as
electrolysis, and involves the separation of a chemical compound
into its constituent parts or elements by the action
of an electric current and the proper apparatus. Electrolysis
cannot take place, however, unless the liquid in
the tank, commonly called the electrolyte (no relation to
electric light), is a conductor.</p>

<p>Water, or water with mixtures of chemicals, such as sulphate
of copper, sulphate of zinc, chloride of nickel, cyanide
and nitrate of silver, or uranium and other metallic salts,
are good conductors. Oil is a non-conductor, and a current
will not pass through it, no matter what the pressure may
be. The simplest electro-plating outfit, and the one that
a boy should start with, is the sulphate of copper bath,
such as is commonly employed by makers of electrotypes,
and which is in extensive use by refiners of copper for
high-grade electrical use.</p>

<p>More than half of the total output of copper in the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page267">[267]</span>
is used for electrical work&mdash;conductors, switches, and all
sorts of parts&mdash;and since any impurity in the copper interferes
with its conducting powers, it is most important that
it should be free from any traces of carbon or arsenic. The
electrolytic refining of copper is now a very important
process in connection with electric work, and about half a
million tons of copper are treated annually to free it from
all impurities. Moreover, the gold, silver, and other valuable
metals which may be found in copper-ore are thus
recovered.</p>

<p>The electro-plating, electrotyping, and refining operations
are one and the same thing; but in the first instance the
object to be plated is left in the solution only a short time
or until a blush of copper has been applied. In the second
process the wax mold is left in long enough for a thin
shell of copper to be deposited; and in the third, the
kathodes are immersed until they are heavily coated with
copper. To carry on any of these operations it will be
necessary to have a small tank or glass jar to hold the
plating-bath or electrolyte. Preferably it should be of a
square or oblong shape. But a serviceable tank may be
constructed from white-wood, pine, or cypress, if proper
care is taken in making and water-proofing (<a href="#FigXI1">Fig. 1</a>). For
experimental purposes a tank eighteen inches long, ten inches
wide, and twelve inches deep will be quite large enough to
use as a copper bath. For silver, nickel, or gold, smaller
tanks should be employed, as they contain less liquid, or
electrolyte, which in the more valuable metals is expensive.</p>

<p>Obtain a clear plank twelve inches wide, well seasoned,
and free from knots or sappy places. Cut two sides twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page268">[268]</span>
inches long and two ends eight inches long. With chisel,
saw, and plane shape the ends of the side planks as shown
at <a href="#FigXI2">Fig. 2</a>; or if there is a mill at hand it would be well to
have the ends cut with a buzz-saw, thus insuring that they
will be accurate and fit snugly. Screw-holes are bored
with a gimlet-bit, and countersunk, so that screws will pass
freely through them and take hold in the edges of the
boards. Screws and plenty of white-lead, or asphaltum
varnish, should be used on these points to make them
water-tight; then the lower edge of the frame is prepared
for the bottom board. Turn the tank bottom up, and,
with a fat steel-wire nail and a hammer, dent a groove at
the middle of the edge of the planks all around, as shown
in <a href="#FigXI3">Fig. 3</a>. It will not do to cut this out with a gouge-chisel,
because it is intended that the wood should swell
out again if necessary. The object of driving the wood
down is to form a valley into which a line of cotton string-wicking,
soaked in asphaltum varnish or imbedded in
white-lead, may be laid. This should be done (as shown
in <a href="#FigXI4">Fig. 4</a>) before the bottom is screwed on, so that afterwards
(in the event of the joint leaking) the wood will
swell and force the wicking out, and thus properly close
the fissure.</p>

<p>The bottom board should be provided with holes all
around the edge, not more than two inches apart, through
which screws can be driven into the lower edge of the
tank. Treat the wood, both in and outside, to several
successive coats of asphaltum varnish, and as a result you
will have a tank resembling <a href="#FigXI1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>Two shallow grooves are to be cut in the top of each<span class="pagenum" id="Page269">[269]</span>
end board of the tank, for the cross-bars to fit in immovably.
These bars should be about three inches apart; and
the ones holding the anodes, or flat copper plates, should
be close to one side, leaving plenty of room for objects of
various sizes to be properly immersed.</p>

<p>Another manner in which the bottom of the tank can
be attached is shown in <a href="#FigXI5">Fig. 5</a>, which is a view of the tank
sides turned bottom up. A rabbet is cut from the lower
edges of the sides and ends, before they are screwed together,
and a bottom is fashioned of such shape as to
accurately fit in the lap formed by the rabbet. This rabbet
and the outer edge of the bottom plank should be well
smeared with white-lead, and all put together at the same
time, driving the screws into the edge of the bottom plank,
through the lower edges of the sides and bottom, and also
through the bottom board into the lower edges of the sides
and ends (<a href="#FigXI6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p>Still another and stronger way in which to make a tank
for a large bath is to cut the planks as shown at <a href="#FigXI7">Fig. 7</a>.
The sides are then bolted together, locking the ends and
bottom, so that they cannot warp or get away. The bolts
are of three-eighth-inch round iron-rod, threaded at both
ends and provided with nuts. Large washers are placed
against the wood and under the nuts, so that when the
nuts are screwed on tightly they will not tear the wood,
but will bear on the washers. The points are all to be
well smeared with white-lead or acid-proof cement (see
Formulæ) before the parts are put together and bolted, so
as to avoid any possibility of leakage. (<a href="#FigXI8">Fig. 8</a> shows the
completed tank.)</p>

<p class="caption">TANK FOR ELECTRO-PLATING</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page271">[271]</span></p>

<p>Now obtain two copper rods long enough to span the tank,
with an inch or two projecting beyond the tank at either
side. At one end of these attach binding-posts, to which the
wires from a battery can be connected, leaving the opposite
ends free, as shown at <a href="#FigXI9">Fig. 9</a> (see <a href="#Page275">page 275</a>). Anodes, or
pure soft copper plates, are hung on the positive rod, while
on the negative one the objects to be plated, or kathodes,
are suspended on fine copper wires just heavy enough to
properly conduct the current. The positive wire leads
from the carbon, or copper pole, of the battery, while the
negative one is connected with the zinc. The anodes are
plates of soft sheet or cast copper, and should be as nearly
pure as possible for electrolytic work; but if they are to be
re-deposited, to free them from impurities, they may be in
thin ingot form, just as the copper comes from the mines.</p>

<p>The general principle of electro-refining of copper is very
simple. A cast plate of the crude copper is hung from the
positive pole in a bath of sulphate of copper, made by dissolving
all the sulphate of copper, or bluestone, that the
water will take up. Drop a few lumps on the bottom of
the tank to supply any deficiency, then add an ounce of
sulphuric acid to each gallon of liquid, to make it more
active and a better conductor.</p>

<p>The crude copper plate is to be the leading-in pole for
the current, while a thin sheet of pure copper, no thicker
than tissue-paper, is suspended from the opposite rod for
the leading-out pole; or in place of the thin sheet, some
copper wires may be suspended from the rod. The electrodes&mdash;that
is, the copper plate and the thin sheet or
wires&mdash;are placed close together, so that the current may<span class="pagenum" id="Page272">[272]</span>
pass freely and not cause internal resistance in the battery.
The electric current, in its passage from the crude copper
plate to the pure copper sheet or wires, decomposes the
sulphate of copper solution and causes it to deposit its
metallic copper on the sheet or wires; and at the same time
it takes from the crude copper a like portion of metallic
copper and converts it into chemical copper. The electric
current really takes the copper from the solution and adds
it to the pure copper sheet, while the remaining constituents
of the decomposed solution help themselves to some copper
from the crude plate. In this way the crude copper diminishes
and the pure copper sheet increases in size, the
impurities as well as the salts of other metals being precipitated
to the bottom of the tank, or mingled with the
solution, which must be purified or replaced from time to
time by fresh solution. This is the process of copper-plating,
and any metal object may be properly cleansed
and coated with copper by suspending it in the bath and
running the current through it.</p>

<p>When the refining process is employed, any metal will
answer as a depository for the copper, but as the intention
is to produce a pure copper plate which can be melted and
cast into ingots, it is of course necessary to have the original
kathode of the same metal; otherwise an impure mixture
will be the result. If, for example, a piece of cast-iron be
used upon which to deposit the copper, then the iron will
be enclosed in a deposit of pure copper; in other words, the
result will be a heavily copper-plated piece of iron, and the
smelting process will bring about a fusion of the two metals.
It is not necessary to have absolutely pure copper for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page273">[273]</span>
anodes when copper-plating or electrotyping; but the
purer the copper the less the solution is fouled, and it will
not require replenishing so often.</p>

<p>An object intended to receive a plating of copper need
not be of metal at all; it may be of any material, so long as
it possesses a conducting surface. A mold or a cast made
of any plastic material, such as wax or cement, may have
its surface made conductive by the application of graphite,
finely pulverized carbon, or metal dusts held on by some
medium not soluble in water. The wax molds, or impressions
of type and cuts, are dusted with plumbago, and
then suspended in the copper solution. A wire from the
negative pole is connected so as to come in contact with
the plumbago, and the copper deposit immediately begins
to form on the face of the wax. When the film of copper
has become heavy enough, the mold is drawn out of the
solution, and the thin shell of metal removed from the wax
and cut apart, so that each shell is separated from its
neighbor and freed from marginal scraps. Flowers, leaves,
laces, and various other objects can be given a coat of
copper by thus preparing their surfaces, and some most
beautiful effects may be secured by copper-coating roses;
then placing them for a short time in a gold bath, and
afterwards chemically treating the surface plating so as
to imitate Roman, Tuscan, or ormolu gold, in bright or
antique finish. Coins, medallions, bas-reliefs, medals, and
various other things are reproduced by the electro-plating
process, and their surfaces finished in gold, silver, bronze,
or other effects. Years ago this was not possible, because
the old method was to make a fac-simile cast in metal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page274">[274]</span>
the object desired, and then chase or refinish the surface.
This was a costly and tedious task. When Brugnalelli, an
Italian electrician, electro-gilded two silver coins in 1805,
he laid the foundation for the modern process, but it did
not come into general use until about 1839, when electro-plating
and the electro-depositing of metals was begun on
a practical scale. Before the invention of the dynamos
for generating current, batteries had to be employed, and
this made the process somewhat more expensive than the
present method. Our boy amateurs, however, will have to
be content with the battery system, since they are not supposed
to have access to direct-current power, such as is
used for arc or street lighting.</p>

<p>Various forms of batteries may be used for this work,
and they will be described in detail. For the copper-plating
bath it will be necessary to have the anodes of soft,
cast, or sheet, copper sufficiently heavy so as not to waste
away too quickly. These should be of the proper size to
fit within the bath, and either one large one or several
small ones may be employed. Stout copper bands should
be riveted to the top of the plates, by means of which they
may be hung on the bar and so suspended in the solution
(<a href="#FigXI10">Fig. 10</a>). The contact-points should be kept clean and
bright, so that the current will not meet with any resistance
in passing from the rod to the plates.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FigXI9">Fig. 9</a> a complete outfit is shown for any plating process,
the difference being only in the solution and anodes.
For silver-plating a silver solution and silver anodes are
required, while for gold the gold solution and gold anodes
will be necessary. In this illustration, A represents the<span class="pagenum" id="Page275">[275]</span>
tank, B the battery, C C the anodes, D D D the kathodes, or
articles to be plated, E the positive rod, F the negative,
and G, H the leading-in and leading-out wires.</p>

<p>There is often a doubt in a boy’s mind as to how the
battery is to be connected up to the bath and the articles
suspended in it. But there will be no difficulty about it
once that the principle of the process is thoroughly understood.</p>

</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>It is well to remember that the electro-plating bath is
just the reverse of a battery in its action. The process
carried on in a battery is the generation of electricity by
the action of the acid on the positive metal, accompanied
by the formation of a salt on one of the elements; while in
the plating-bath the current from an external source (the
battery or dynamo) breaks up the salts in solution and
deposits the metal on one of the elements (the kathode).</p>

<p>The remaining element in the solution attacks the salts,
in chemical lumps or granular form, and dissolves them to
take the place of the exhausted salts; or it attacks the<span class="pagenum" id="Page276">[276]</span>
metal anode from which these salts were originally made,
and eats off the portion necessary to replace the loss caused
by the action of the current in depositing the fruits of this
robbery in metallic form upon the article to be plated (the
kathode). There should be no confusion in the matter of
properly connecting the poles if one remembers that the
current is flowing through the battery as well as through
the wires and the solution in the tank.</p>

<p>Get clearly in your mind that the current originates in
the battery of zinc and carbon or zinc and copper. The
zinc is electro-positive to carbon or copper, and at a higher
electric level the current flows from the zinc plate inside
the cell to the carbon or copper; therefore, the zinc is the
positive pole. Now the current, having flowed through the
battery from zinc to carbon, or the negative plate, is bound
to flow out of the battery from the carbon through the
apparatus and back again to the zinc in the battery. Therefore,
the wire (G) attached to the carbon of the battery
leads a positive or + current, although the carbon is
negative; in the battery, and the wire (H) leading out is
negative, or -, although it returns the current to the
positive pole of the battery.</p>

<p>This is the simple explanation of the circulation of current;
but to cut it down still more, always remember to
attach the wire from the anode rod to the carbon, or copper,
of the battery, and the kathode rod to the zinc of the
battery.</p>

<p>In copper-plating this is easy to determine without any
regard to wires, because if the wires are misconnected there
will be no deposit, and the kathode will turn a dark color.<span class="pagenum" id="Page277">[277]</span>
If everything is all right a slight rose-colored blush of
copper will appear at once on the kathode. Too little
current will make the process a long and tedious one, while
too much current will deposit a brown mud on the kathode,
which will have to be washed off or removed and the article
thoroughly cleansed before a new action is allowed to take
place.</p>

<p>With a series of cells it is an easy matter to properly govern
the current by cutting out some of the cells or by using
resistance-coils (see <a href="#Page125">chapter vii.</a> on Electrical Resistance).</p>

<p>Cells and batteries for electro-plating may be made or
purchased, and primary batteries should be used. The use
of the secondary or storage-battery is not necessary for
plating purposes, since no great volume of current is needed,
and it can be generated in a battery of cells while the work
is going on.</p>

<p>One of the best primary batteries is the Benson cell,
shown in connection with the <a href="#FigXI9">plating-bath</a>, and also in <a href="#FigXI11">Fig.
11</a>. It consists of an outer glass jar (G J), which contains
a cylinder of amalgamated zinc (Z +, or positive) covered
with diluted sulphuric acid&mdash;one part acid to three parts
water. An inner porous cup (P C) contains concentrated
nitric acid, into which the carbon (C -, or negative) is
plunged. The liquid in the inner cup and glass cell should
be at the same level.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BENSON CELL PRIMARY BATTERY</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page279">[279]</span></p>

<p>There is no polarizing in this cell, for the hydrogen
liberated at the zinc plate, in passing through the nitric
acid on its way to the carbon-pole, decomposes the nitric
acid and is itself oxidized. A cell with a glass jar six inches
in diameter and eight inches high will develop about two
volts of electro-motive force; and as its internal resistance
is very low it will furnish a steady current for several hours.
Any number of these cells may be made and connected in
series; but when not in use it would be well to remove and
wash the zincs. Any bichromate battery will answer very
well for plating, the Grenet being an especially good one.
A well-amalgamated zinc plate forms one pole, and a pair
of carbon plates, one on each side of the zinc and joined at
the top, make up the other pole. When not in use the
entire plunge part should be removed from the bichromate
solution, rinsed off in water, and laid across the top of the
jar, ready for its next employment. The zinc and carbons
must be joined together so that they are well insulated, and
with no chance of the zinc coming into contact with the
carbons. This may be done with four pieces of hard-wood
soaked in hot paraffine and then locked together with
stove-bolts and nuts, as shown at <a href="#FigXI12">Fig. 12</a>. Holes must be
made in the top corners of the carbons and zinc, and with
small bolts and nuts the connecting wires can be made
fast.</p>

<p>To charge this battery, add five fluid ounces of sulphuric
acid to three pints of cold water, pouring the acid slowly
into the water and stirring it at the same time with a glass
or carbon rod. When this becomes cold, after standing a
few hours, add six ounces of finely pulverized bichromate
of potash. Mix this thoroughly, and pour some of the
solution into the glass cell until it is three-fourths full;
then it will be ready to receive the carbons and zinc. When
arranging the wood-clamps on the carbon and zinc plates
it would be well to make two of the clamps longer than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page280">[280]</span>
others so that they will extend out far enough to rest on
the top edge of the jar. To keep them in position at the
middle of the jar, notches should be cut at the underside
of these clamps, so that they will fit down over the edge of
the jar. Any number of these cells may be connected together
to obtain the desired amount of current, or electro-motive
force.</p>

<p>Other batteries suitable for electro-plating are the Edison
primary, Taylor, Fuller, Daniell, gravity, Groves, and
Merdingers. All of these may be purchased at large electrical
equipment or supply houses.</p>

<h4>The Cleansing Process</h4>

<p>One of the most important operations of the plating
process is to properly cleanse the articles to be plated
before they are placed in the bath. When once cleaned
the surfaces of these objects must not be touched with the
fingers, or any dusty or greasy object; otherwise the electro-deposited
metal will not hold on the surface, but will peel
off, in time, or blister. A very small trace of foreign
matter is sufficient to prevent the deposit from adhering
to the surface to be plated; therefore, great care must be
taken to eliminate all trace of anything that would interfere
with the perfect transmission of metallic molecules to
the prepared surfaces. Acids are chiefly employed to remove
foreign matter from new metallic surfaces; and for
copper, brass, iron, zinc, gold, and silver a table is given on
<a href="#Page281">page 281</a> which will show the right proportion of acids to
water in order to cleanse the various metals. In the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page281">[281]</span>
scale the numerals stand for parts. For example: the
first one means 100 parts water, 50 parts nitric acid, 100
parts sulphuric acid, and 2 parts hydrochloric acid&mdash;making
in all 252 parts. These can be measured in a glass graduate.</p>

<p>Twist a piece of fine copper wire about part of the object
to be cleaned and plated; then dip it in the acid and rinse
off in clean warm or hot water, and rub the surface briskly
with a brush dipped in the liquid. Dip it again several
times, and rinse in the same manner; then, when it is bright
and clean, place it in the bath, twist the loose end of the
wire around the negative rod, and start the current flowing,
taking care that the object is thoroughly immersed.</p>

<p>Tarnished gold or silver articles may be cleaned by immersing
them in a hot solution of cyanide of potassium;
or a strong warm solution of carbonate of ammonia will
loosen the tarnish on silver, so that it can be brushed off.
Corroded brass, copper, German-silver, and bronze should
be cleansed in a solution composed of sulphuric acid, three
ounces; nitric acid, one and three-quarters ounces; and
water, four ounces. This soon loosens and dissolves the
corrosion; then the article should be brushed off, dipped in
hot water, and rinsed. Then replace it in the solution for<span class="pagenum" id="Page282">[282]</span>
a minute or two and rinse again, when it will be ready for
the plating-bath.</p>

<p>Corroded zinc should be immersed in a solution of sulphuric
acid, one ounce; hydrochloric acid, two ounces; and
distilled or rain water, one gallon. It should be well brushed
after the acid has bitten off the corrosion.</p>

<p>Rusty iron or steel should be pickled in a solution of
sulphuric acid, six ounces, hydrochloric acid, one ounce,
and water, one gallon. When the rust has been removed,
immerse the object in a solution composed of sulphuric acid,
one pint, and distilled water, one gallon. Before the acid
is added to the water dissolve one-quarter-pound of sulphate
of zinc in the water; then add the acid, pouring it
slowly and stirring the water.</p>

<p>Lead, tin, pewter, and their compounds may be cleansed
by immersing them in a hot solution of caustic soda or
potash, then rinsing in hot water. Take great care if
caustic is used, as it will burn the skin and tissues of
the body. Do not let the fingers come into contact with
any cleansed article, because the oily secretions of the body
will stick to the metal and cause the coat of deposited metal
to strip off or present a spotted appearance.</p>

<h4>The Plating-bath</h4>

<p>The object to be plated should not touch the bottom or
sides of the plating-vat, and it should be far enough away
from the anodes to avoid any possibility of coming into
contact with them. It will not do to place the anode and
kathode too close together, as the plate will be deposited<span class="pagenum" id="Page283">[283]</span>
unevenly; the thicker coating will appear on the parts
closest to the anode. Neither should they be separated too
far, as the resistance of the cell is thereby increased, and of
course this means a waste of energy. The knowledge of how
to arrange the anode and kathode is a matter to be learned
by experience, but by carefully watching the deposit it will
not be a difficult matter to determine the proper positions.</p>

<p>For many reasons the glass tank is preferable for amateur
electro-plating work, since the objects may be watched
without disturbing their electric connections and without
removing them from the liquid. A very good plan for the
copper bath, when spherical, cylindrical, or hollow objects
are to be plated, is to line the inside of the tank with strips
or a sheet of copper, hung on hooks that will catch on the
sides; then connect the positive wire directly to these strips.
With this arrangement but one rod, the negative, is in use,
and the objects to be plated are suspended from it. It
follows that the objects will take up the copper deposit
from all sides, and a more evenly distributed coating will
be the result.</p>

<p>It is better to start up the current gradually, rather than
to put on at the beginning a large amount of electro-motive
force. By watching the character of the deposit you can
soon tell if you have the proper strength of current. If
everything is working properly the copper deposit will have
a beautiful flesh tint; but if the current is too strong it
takes on a dark-red tone and resembles the surface of a
brick. This is not right, and the object must be removed
and washed off, the current reduced, and the object replaced
in the bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page284">[284]</span></p>

<p>When a sufficiently heavy coating of the copper has been
applied, remove the object and wash thoroughly in running
or warm water to free it from any remaining copper fluid.
If this is not done the surface, in drying, will turn a dull
brown, and will have to be bitten off with the acid solution
for cleansing copper.</p>

<p>The finer the copper deposit the better and smoother it
will be; the grain will be smaller, and it will not present a
rough surface, which is always difficult to plate over with
silver or gold, unless a frosted effect is desired. Non-conducting
objects are usually plated with copper first, and
then replated with the metal desired for the final finish.</p>

<p>To make the surface conductive, finely powdered black-lead,
or plumbago of the best kind, or finely pulverized
gas-carbon is brushed over the surface. This must be thoroughly
done; and if the deposit is slow about appearing at
any spot it may be hastened by touching it with the end of
an insulated wire attached to the main conductor. This,
of course, will only answer for objects strong enough to
stand the brushing treatment; it will not do for flowers,
insects, and other delicate things, that are to be silver or
gold plated. These should be given a film of silver by soaking
in a solution of alcohol and nitrate of silver, made by
shaking two parts of the chemical into one hundred parts
of grain-alcohol, with the aid of heat and in a well-corked
bottle. When dry, the object should be subjected to a
bath of sulphuretted hydrogen gas under a hood. The
sulphuretted hydrogen is made by bringing a bar of wrought-iron
to a white-heat in the kitchen range or furnace fire, and
touching it with a stick of sulphur. The iron will melt and<span class="pagenum" id="Page285">[285]</span>
drop like wax. These drops should be collected in a bottle.
Now pour over them diluted sulphuric acid, one part acid to
three parts water, and the gas will at once rise. It will be
quickly recognized by its odor, which is similar to that of
over-ripe eggs. It can be led off through a tube to the
place where you wish to use it, and when through, the
operation of gas-generation may be stopped by pouring off
the liquid.</p>

<p>All objects prepared in this way should be given a preliminary
coating of thin copper before they are plated with
any other metal.</p>

<h4>Silver-plating</h4>

<p>Plating in silver is done in practically the same way as
described for the coppering process. Thin strips or sheets
of pure silver are used for the anodes, and the electrolyte
is composed of nitrate of silver, cyanide of potassium, and
water.</p>

<p>Dissolve three and one-half ounces of nitrate of silver in
one gallon of water; or if more water is needed to fill the
tank, add it in the proportion of three and one-half ounces
of the nitrate to each gallon of water. Dissolve two ounces
of cyanide of potassium in a quart of water, and slowly add
this to the nitrate solution. A precipitate of cyanide of
silver will be formed. Keep adding and stirring until no
more precipitate is formed, but be careful not to get an
excess of the cyanide in the solution.</p>

<p>Gather this precipitate, and wash it on filtering-paper by
pouring water over it. The filter-paper should be rolled in
a funnel shape thus permitting the water to run away<span class="pagenum" id="Page286">[286]</span>
and leaving the precipitate in the paper. This precipitate
is to be dissolved in more cyanide solution, and added to
the quantity in the tank. There should be about two
ounces of the potassium cyanide per gallon over and above
what was originally put in.</p>

<p>The silver anodes show the condition of the fluid. If
the solution is in good order they will have a clear, creamy
appearance, but will tarnish or turn pink if there is not
sufficient free cyanide in the solution.</p>

<p>The proper strength of current is indicated by the appearance
of the plated objects. A clear white surface
shows that everything is all right, the solution in proper
working order, and the proper current to do the work.
Too much current will make the color of the kathodes
yellow or gray, while too little current will act slowly and
require a long time to deposit the silver.</p>

<p>The adhesion of silver-plate is rendered more perfect by
amalgamating the objects in a solution of nitrate of mercury,
one ounce to one gallon of water. After the objects have
been properly cleansed they are immersed in this solution
for a minute, then placed in the silver-bath and connected
with the negative-rod, so that the electro-depositing action
begins at once.</p>

<h4>Gold-plating</h4>

<p>The gold-bath is made in the same manner as the silver
one just described, with the exception that chloride of gold
is used in place of the nitrate of silver in the first solution.
This solution must be heated to 150° Fahrenheit when the
process is going on; or a cold bath may be made of water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page287">[287]</span>
5000 parts; potassium cyanide, one hundred parts; and pure
gold, fifty parts. The gold must be dissolved in hydrochloric
acid, and added to the water and potassium.</p>

<p>Very pretty effects may be obtained in gold-plating by
changing the tones from yellow to a greenish hue by the
addition of a little cyanide of silver to the solution, or by
the use of a silver anode. A reddish tinge may be had
by adding a small portion of sulphate of copper to the
solution, or hanging a small copper anode beside the gold
one. In the hot gold-bath the articles should be kept in
motion, or the solution stirred about them with a glass
rod.</p>

<p>When the solution is perfectly balanced and working
right the anodes should be a clear dead yellow, and the
articles in process of plating should be of the same hue.</p>

<p>A gold-plating outfit is shown in <a href="#FigXI13">Fig. 13</a>, and consists of
the tank and bath, a cell, and a resistance-coil (R), through
which the strength of the current is regulated.</p>

<p>The current, passing out of the cell from the carbon (C),
is regulated through the resistance-coils (R) by the switch
(S). From thence it passes to the rod from which the
anode (A) is suspended, across the electrolyte (E) to the
kathode (K), on which the metal is deposited, and then
returns through the negative wire to the zinc (Z) in the
cell. If the hot bath is used the gold solution may be contained
in a glazed earthen jar or a porcelain-lined metal
jar or kettle. But if the latter is used care must be taken
to see that none of the enamel is chipped, or a short-circuit
will be established between the rods. This jar or kettle
may then be placed on a gas-stove, and a thermometer<span class="pagenum" id="Page288">[288]</span>
should be suspended so that the mercury bulb is half an
inch below the surface of the liquid, as shown at T in <a href="#FigXI13">Fig.
13</a>. As the liquid simmers or evaporates away a little
water should be added from time to time to keep the bulk
of the liquid up to its normal or original quantity.</p>

<h4>Nickel-plating</h4>

<p>The nickel-plating process is similar, in a general way,
to the others; it is carried on in a cold bath&mdash;that is, at the
normal temperature, without being heated or chilled artificially.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page289">[289]</span></p>

<p>There are a great many formulæ for the nickel as well
as for the other baths, but the generally accepted one is
composed of double nickel ammonium-sulphate, three parts;
ammonium carbonate, three parts; and water, one hundred
parts. Another good one is composed of nickel sulphate,
nitrate, or chloride, one part; sodium bisulphate, one part;
and water, twenty parts.</p>

<p>Nickel anodes are used in bath to maintain the strength,
and great care must be taken to have the bath perfectly
balanced&mdash;that is, not too acid nor too alkaline.</p>

<p>To test this, have some blue-and-red litmus paper. If
the blue paper is dipped in an acid solution, it will turn red;
and back to blue again if placed in an alkaline solution.
If the nickel solution is too strong with alkali, a trifle more
of the nickel salts must be added, so that both the red-and-blue
litmus paper, when dipped in the liquid, will not
change color. If the bath is too alkaline, it will give a disagreeable
yellowish color to the deposit of metal on the
kathode; and if too acid, the metal will not adhere properly
to the kathode, and will strip, peel, or blister off.</p>

<h4>Finishing</h4>

<p>When the articles have been plated they will have a
somewhat different appearance to what may have been
expected. For instance, copper-plated articles will have a
bright fleshy-pink hue; silver, an opaque creamy-white;
gold, a dead lemon-yellow color, and nickel much the appearance
of the silver, but slightly bluer in its tone. Articles
removed from the bath should be shaken over the bath so<span class="pagenum" id="Page290">[290]</span>
as to remove the solution; then they should be immediately
plunged into hot water, rinsed thoroughly, and allowed to
dry slowly.</p>

<p>When a silvered or gilded object is perfectly dry it should
be rubbed rapidly with a brush and some fine silver-polishing
powder until the opaque white or yellow gives place to
a silver or gold lustre. It will then be ready for burnishing
with a steel burnisher, or the article may be left with a
frosted silver or gold surface. Steel burnishers can be had
at any tool-supply house, and when used they should be
frequently dipped in castile soapy water to lubricate them.
They will then glide smoothly over the surface of the deposited
metal, driving the grain down and making it bright at the
same time. If the soapy water were not used the action of
the hard burnisher over the plate would have a tendency
to tear away the film of deposited metal. The burnisher
must always be clean and bright, otherwise it would scratch
the plated articles; and, when not in use, keep the bright
polishing surfaces wrapped in a piece of oiled flannel.</p>

<p>Small articles, such as sleeve-buttons, rings, studs, and
other things not larger than a twenty-five-cent piece, may
be polished by being tumbled in a sawdust bag. A cotton
bag is made, three feet long and six inches in diameter,
closed at one end and half-filled with fine sawdust. The
articles are then put in the bag and the end closed. Grasp
the ends of the bag with both hands, as if to jump rope with
it; then swing it to and fro, until the articles have had a
good tumbling. Look at them to see if they are bright
enough; if not, keep up the tumbling.</p>

<p>When old work is to be re-plated, or gone over, it will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page291">[291]</span>
necessary to remove all of the old plate before a really good
job can be done. In some cases it may be removed with a
scratch-brush or pumice-stone; but, as a rule, it can be
removed much quicker and more satisfactorily with acids.</p>

<p>Silver may be removed from copper, brass, or German-silver
with a solution of sulphuric acid, with one ounce of
nitrate of potash to each two quarts of acid. Stir the
potash into the acid, then immerse the article. If the
action becomes weak before the silver is all off, then heat
the solution and add more of the potash (saltpetre). Gold
may be removed from silver by heating the article to a
cherry-red, and dropping it into diluted sulphuric acid&mdash;one
part acid to two parts water. This will cause the gold
to peel and fall off easily.</p>

<h4>Electrotyping</h4>

<p>The term electrotyping is interpreted in several ways,
but, in general, it means the process of electro-plating an
article, or mold, with a metal coating, generally copper, of
sufficient thickness, so that when it is removed, or separated
from its original, it forms an independent object
which, to all appearances, will be a fac-simile of the original.</p>

<p>To obtain a positive copy a cast has to be taken from a
negative or reverse. This negative is called the mold or
matrix, and can be of plaster, glue, wax, or other compositions.
There are a number of processes in use, but the
Adams process (no relation to the author) will give a boy a
clear idea of this electro-chemical and mechanical art.
This process was patented in 1870, and is said to give a<span class="pagenum" id="Page292">[292]</span>
perfect conduction to wax and other molds, with greater
certainty and rapidity than any other, and will accomplish
in a few minutes that which plumbago (black-lead) alone
would require from two to four hours to effect.</p>

<p>As applied to the electrotyping of type, and cuts for
illustration, the warm wax impression is taken by pressing
the chase or form of type into a bed of wax by power or
hydraulic pressure. Then remove it, and while the wax is
still warm, powdered tin, bronze, or white bronze powder
is freely dusted all over it with a soft hair-brush, until the
surface presents a bright, metallic appearance. The superfluous
powder is then dusted off, and the mold is immersed
in alcohol, and afterwards washed in water to remove the
air from the surface. It is then placed in the copper bath
and the connection made from the negative pole to the face
of the mold, so that the current will flow over its entire
surface. A deposit of copper will quickly appear, and become
heavier as the mold is left in longer.</p>

<p>When a mold has received the required deposit it should
be taken from the bath and the copper film removed from
it. This is done by placing the mold in an inclined position
and passing a stream of hot water over the back of the
copper film. This softens the wax and enables one to strip
the film off, taking care at the same time not to crack or
bend the thin copper positive.</p>

<p>The thin coating of wax, which adheres to the face of the
copper, can be removed by placing it, face up, on a wire
rack and pouring a solution of caustic potash over it, which,
in draining through, will fall into a vessel or tank beneath
the rack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page293">[293]</span></p>

<p>The potash dissolves the wax in a short time, and the
electro-deposited shell may then be rinsed in several changes
of cold water, or held under the faucet until thoroughly
freed from the caustic.</p>

<p>As many, if not all, of the chemicals used in the various
plating processes, and also the cleaning fluids, are highly
poisonous, great care should be taken when handling them.
Do not let the fingers or hands come in contact with
caustic solutions or cyanide baths.</p>

<p>Never use any of these solutions if you have recently cut
your fingers or hands, and do not allow the cyanides or
caustics to get under the finger-nails. Never add any acid
to liquids containing cyanide or ferro-cyanide while in a
closed room. This should always be done in the open air,
where the fumes can pass away, for the gases which rise
from these admixtures are poisonous when inhaled.</p>

<h3>Chapter XII<br />
<span class="chaptitle">MISCELLANEOUS APPARATUS</span></h3>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">he</span>
field of applied electricity is such a wide one as
to preclude any exhaustive handling of the subject in
a book of this size. The aim has been to acquaint the
young student with the basic principles of the science, and
it is his part to develop these principles along the lines indicated
in the preceding pages. But there are some practical
applications that may be properly grouped under the
heading of this chapter. They may serve as a stimulus to
the inventive faculties of the youthful experimenter, and
since the pieces of apparatus now to be described are useful
in themselves, the time spent in their construction will
not be wasted.</p>

<h4>A Rotary Glass-cutter</h4>

<p>When making a circle of glass it is generally best to let
a glazier cut the disk, otherwise many panes are likely to
get broken before the young workman succeeds in getting
out a perfect one. But with a rotary glass-cutter the task
is a comparatively simple one, and the tool is really an
indispensable piece of apparatus in every electrician’s kit.
(See <a href="#FigXII1">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#FigXII2">2</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page295">[295]</span></p>

<p>The wooden form is turned from pine or white-wood, and
is three inches in diameter at the large end, or bottom, one
inch in diameter at the top, and two inches high. It is
covered with felt held on with glue. Directly in the middle
of the top a small hole is bored one-eighth of an inch
in diameter, and in this aperture an awl or marker is placed,
handle up, as shown in <a href="#FigXII2">Fig. 2</a>. Notice that the awl is not
made fast to the form, but is removable at pleasure. A
hard brass strip twelve inches long, five-eighths of an inch
wide, and one-eighth of an inch thick is cut at the end to
receive a steel-wheel glass-cutter, as shown at the foot of
<a href="#FigXII1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>A number of one-eighth-inch holes are bored along the
strip, and half an inch apart, measuring from centre to
centre. To cut a disk of glass the form is placed at the
centre of the pane, the latter being imposed on a smooth
table-top over a piece of cloth. The strip, or arm, is laid
on the form, and over a small washer, so that one of the
holes lines with that in the form. The awl is passed down
through the strip and into the block, and the cutter is arranged
in the slot at the end of the arm. Press down lightly
on the handle of the awl, to keep the form from slipping;
then the cutter is drawn around the glass, describing the
circle, and cutting the surface of the glass, as shown by the
solid line in <a href="#FigXII4">Fig. 4</a>. The disk must not be removed from
the pane until the margin is broken away. With a straight-edge
and a cutter score the glass across the corners, as indicated
by the dotted lines in <a href="#FigXII4">Fig. 4</a>; then tap the glass at
the underside along the line and break off the corners.
After the corners have been removed tap the glass again,
following the line of the circle; then break away the remaining
fragments and smooth the edge.</p>

<h4>To Smooth Glass Edges</h4>

<p>To smooth the rough edge of glass there are several
methods. The simplest way is to hold the disk or straight-edge
against a fine grindstone and use plenty of water.
The glass must be held edgewise, as shown in <a href="#FigXII5">Fig. 5</a>, and
<i>not</i> flatwise, as shown in <a href="#FigXII6">Fig. 6</a>. To properly grind a disk
two workmen are necessary, one to turn the stone, and
the other to hold the disk by spreading the hands and
grasping it at the middle on both sides (see <a href="#FigXII5">Fig. 5</a>). In
this manner the glass may be held securely, and slowly
turned, so that an even surface will be ground. When the
flat edge is smoothed, tilt the glass first to one side and
then the other, and grind off the sharp edges.</p>

<p>Another method is to lay the glass on a table, upon a
piece of felt or cloth, and allow the edge to project over
the table for two or three inches. Hold the glass down
with one hand to prevent its slipping; then, with a piece
of corundum, or a rough whetstone and glycerine, work
down the edge until it is smooth, turning the glass continually
so that the edge you are working on hangs over
the table. This process of grinding is somewhat tedious,
but perseverance and patience will win out.</p>

<h4>To Cut Holes in Glass</h4>

<p>Holes may be cut in glass in several ways by an expert,
but the boy who is a novice in this line should stick to<span class="pagenum" id="Page298">[298]</span>
slow and sure methods and take no chances. Fortunately,
glass is little used in voltaic electricity, but it is indispensable
in the construction of the frictional machines, Leyden-jars,
and condensers, where glass is used as the dielectric,
also for the covering-plates to instruments.</p>

<p>The simplest method is that of rotating a copper tube
forward and backward over the glass, using fine emery
dust for the cutting medium and oil of turpentine as a
lubricant. The copper tube must be held in a rack, so
that its location will not shift during the rotating or cutting
motion. The rack in which the tube is held may be
of any size, but to take a disk or square of glass, twenty
inches across, the frame should be twenty-two inches long,
ten inches wide, and twelve inches high, as shown in <a href="#FigXII3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p>The side-plates are eleven inches high and ten inches
wide, the top is twenty-two inches long and ten inches
wide, while the under ledge is twenty and a quarter inches
long by ten inches wide. This frame is put together with
glue and screws. Across the back, from the corners down
to the middle of the under ledge, battens or braces are
made fast to prevent the frame from racking. A hole is
made through the middle of the top and under ledge for
the copper tube to pass through. If different-sized tubes
are to be used, blocks to fit the top and under board are
to be cut and bored, so that they may be held in place
with screws when in use. To cut a hole in glass, place the
disk or pane on a felt or cloth-covered table, and over it
arrange the frame, so that the tube will rest on the spot to
be drilled. Drop the copper tube down through the hole,
having first spread the bottom of the tube slightly, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page299">[299]</span>
it will not split the glass. Now put some emery inside the
tube so that it will fall on the glass; then place a wooden
plug in the top of the tube and arrange an awl, or hand-plate,
so that the tube may be pressed down. Take one
turn about the tube with a linen line, or gut-thong, and
make the ends fast to a bow, so that it will draw the string
taut but not too tight. Lubricate the foot of the tube
with oil of turpentine, and draw the bow back and forth.
At first the motion will cause the copper to scratch the
glass, and then cut it, until finally a perfectly drilled hole is
formed. During the operation both glass and frame must
be held securely, and the bow drawn evenly and without
any jerking motion. Holes of different sizes may be cut
with tubes of various diameters. Small holes may be cut
with a highly tempered steel-drill and glycerine, the drill
being held in a hand-drilling tool or in a brace.</p>

<h4>Anti-hum Device for Metallic Lines</h4>

<p>In overhead wires, where galvanized or hard copper wire
is used, the hum due to the tension of the wires, and the
wind blowing through them, causes a musical vibration
which becomes most annoying at times. This can be overcome
by a simple device known as an “anti-hum.” It consists
of a knob made of wood or rubber, through which a
hole is bored, and around which a groove is cut. One end
of the wire is passed through the hole and a loop formed,
the loose end being wrapped about the incoming wire.
The other end of the line is passed around the knob in the
groove, and the end twisted about the line-wire. The knob<span class="pagenum" id="Page300">[300]</span>
is then an insulator and a sound-deadener at the same time.
To complete the metallic circuit a loop of wire is passed
under the knob, the ends of which are made fast to the
line-wires, as shown at <a href="#FigXII7">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<h4>A Reel-car for Wire</h4>

<p>It is not always convenient nor possible to carry about
a heavy roll of wire when hanging a line, especially if it is
No. 12 galvanized wire, of which there are from fifty to a
hundred pounds in one roll. Wire should be unwound as
it is paid out, and not slipped off from the coil, since it is
liable to kink; therefore, some portable means of transporting
it should be provided. Line-wires over long distances
are paid out from a reel-truck drawn by horses. For the<span class="pagenum" id="Page301">[301]</span>
use of the amateur electrician the reel-car shown in <a href="#FigXII8">Fig. 8</a>
should meet all requirements.</p>

<p>The reel is made from two six-inch boards, a barrel-head
or a round platform of boards, four trunk-rollers, and
a bolt. From a six-inch board cut two pieces five feet
long. Eighteen inches from either end cut one edge away
so as to form handles, as shown at C C C C in <a href="#FigXII8">Fig. 8</a>, rounding
the upper and under edges to take off the sharp corners.
Cut four cross-pieces sixteen inches long; and from
two-by-four-inch spruce joist cut four legs twelve inches
long, and plane the four sides.</p>

<p>Nail two of the cross-pieces to the legs; then nail on the
side-boards and so form the frame of the reel. Bore a half-inch
hole through a piece of joist; then nail it between the
remaining two cross-boards, taking care to get it in the
centre, as shown at A. Arrange these pieces at the middle
of the frame, making them fast with nails driven through
the side-boards and into the ends of these cross-pieces.
Drive some pieces of matched boards together, and with
a string, a nail, and a pencil describe a circle twenty inches
in diameter. With a compass-saw cut the boards on the
line, and join them with four battens made fast at the underside
with nails. Do not make the battens so that they will
extend out to the edge of the circle, but keep them in an
inch or two, so that the under edge of the turn-table will
rest on four trunk-rollers screwed fast to the top edges of
the side-boards and end cross-pieces, as shown at B. A
half-inch bolt is passed down through a hole made at the
middle of the table, and through the block. Between the
block and the underside of the table several large iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page302">[302]</span>
washers should be placed on the bolt, so that they will keep
the table slightly above the rollers, the main weight of the
table and its load of wire being held by the middle cross-brace.
The object of the trunk-rollers is to relieve the
side strain on the bolt, and also to prevent friction between
the edge of the table and the frame, in case the tension on
the wire pulls it to one side. Bore six holes in the table,
on a circle of twelve inches, and drive hard-wood pegs in
them, as shown in <a href="#FigXII8">Fig. 8</a>. When a roll of wire is lying on
the table two boys can easily lift and carry the car, and as
they do so the wire will pay out. Give all the wood-work
a coat of dark-green paint, and oil the trunk-rollers and
the wood where the bolt passes through. A pair of nuts
should be placed on the lower end of the bolt and a washer
under its head. These lock-nuts must be screwed on with
two monkey-wrenches, forced in opposite directions, so that
one nut will be driven tightly against the other. This is to
prevent the turning of the table from unscrewing the nuts.</p>

<h4>Insulators</h4>

<p>For telegraph and telephone lines, where pole, tree, or
building attachments are necessary, insulators must be used
to carry the wires without loss of current. The regular
glass, porcelain, or hard rubber insulators, made for pole
and bracket use, are of course the best. They can be purchased
at any supply-house for a few cents each, but there
are other devices which will answer equally well and which
will cost little or nothing.</p>

<p>Obtain some bottles of stout glass, the green or dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page303">[303]</span>
glass being the toughest; then carefully break the bottle
part away. In doing this hold the bottle by the neck,
with a piece of old cloth wrapped about it, to prevent the
glass chips from flying. Save all of the neck and part of
the shoulder, as shown in <a href="#FigXII9">Fig. 9</a>, so that the wire and its
anchoring loop will not slip off and fall down on the peg
or cross-tree.</p>

<p>Hard-wood pegs cut from sticks one inch and a half
square should be whittled down so that they will fit in the
neck and come up to the top. The pegs should be long
enough at the bottom to permit of their being fastened to
the supporting poles, trees, or building. In <a href="#FigXII10">Fig. 10</a> three
ways of attaching insulators are shown. At A the peg is
nailed to the top of a pole, or a hole is bored in the pole
and the peg driven down in it. At B two sticks with peg
ends are nailed to a pole in the form of a <span class="symbol">V</span>, and across
the sticks a cross-brace is made fast to prevent the sticks
from spreading or dropping down. This cross-brace is
made fast to both the sticks and the pole so as to form
a rigid triangle. At C the usual form of cross-tree, or <span class="symbol">T</span>
brace, is shown. The pegs may be nailed to the face of the
cross-plate, or holes may be bored in the top and the pegs
driven down into them. If the cross-piece is more than
two feet long, bracket-iron should be screwed fast to the
pole and brace at both sides, as shown at C. Where a cross-plate
is made fast to a pole, a lap should be cut out so that
the plate can lie against a flat surface rather than on a
round one (see D in <a href="#FigXII10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>The shoulder of the bottle-necks must not rest on a cross-piece,
or touch anything that would lead to the ground or<span class="pagenum" id="Page304">[304]</span>
to other wires. The shoulder acts as a collar, and so sheds
water that in wet weather the current cannot be grounded
through the rain. The underside of the collar should always
be dry, and also that part of the peg protected by the
collar, thereby insuring against the loss of current. The
relative position of insulator and peg is shown at <a href="#FigXII9">Fig. 9</a>,
and if the pegs are cut carefully the bottle-necks should
fit them accurately.</p>

<h4>Joints and Splices</h4>

<p>It is essential in electrical work to have joints, splices,
unions, and contacts made perfectly tight, so that the current
will flow through them uninterruptedly. A poor contact
or weak joint may throw a whole system out of order.
For this reason all joints should be soldered wherever practicable.
In line work, however, this is impossible, except
where trolley-wires are joined, and these are brazed in the
open air by an apparatus especially designed for the purpose.
In telegraph and telephone lines perfect contact is
absolutely necessary, and where attachments are made to
insulators the main-line should never be turned around
the insulator. The wire is brought up against the insulator,
and with a <span class="symbol">U</span> wire the main-line is tightly bound to
it, as shown at <a href="#FigXII11">Fig. 11</a>. If it is necessary to bind the main-line
more securely to the insulator, one or two turns may
be taken around the insulator with the <span class="symbol">U</span> or anchoring wire;
then with a pair of plyers a tight wrap is made.</p>

<p>When joining two ends of wire together, never make
loops as shown in <a href="#FigXII12">Fig. 12</a> A. This construction gives poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page305">[305]</span>
contact, for the wire loops will wear and finally break
apart. Moreover, the rust that forms between the loops
will often cause an open circuit and one difficult to locate.
Care must be taken to make all splices secure and with perfect
contact of wires, and the only manner in which this can
be done is to pass the ends of wires together for three or
four inches, as shown in <a href="#FigXII12">Fig. 12</a> B.</p>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">

</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Grasp one wire with a pair of plyers, and with the fingers
start the coil or twist, then with another pair of plyers
finish the wrapping evenly and snugly. Treat the other
end in a similar manner, and as a result you will have the
splice pictured in <a href="#FigXII12">Fig. 12</a> B, the many wraps insuring perfect
contact. This same method is to be employed for inside
wires, and after the wrap is made heat the joint and<span class="pagenum" id="Page306">[306]</span>
touch it with soldering solution. The solder will run in
between the coils and permanently unite the joint. The
bare wires should then be covered with adhesive tape.</p>

<p>Avoid sharp turns and angles in lines, and where it is not
possible to arrange them otherwise it would be well to put
in a curved loop, as shown at <a href="#FigXII13">Fig. 13</a>. A represents a pole,
B B the line, and C the quarter-circular loop let in to avoid
the sharp turn about the insulator. The current will pass
around the angle as well as through the loop, but a galvanometer
test would show that the greater current passed
through the loop and avoided the sharp turn.</p>

<h4>“Grounds”</h4>

</div><!--container-->

<p>In the <a href="#Page190">chapter</a> on wireless telegraphy several good
“grounds” were described, any one of which would be admirably
adapted to telegraph or telephone circuits. In
<a href="#FigXII14">Figs. 14</a>, <a href="#FigXII15">15</a>, and <a href="#FigXII16">16</a> are illustrated three other “grounds”
that can easily be made from inexpensive material. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page307">[307]</span>
first one, <a href="#FigXII14">Fig. 14</a>, is an ordinary tin pan with the wire
soldered to the middle of the bottom. The wire must be
soldered to be of use, as the pan would soon rust around a
simple hole and make the “ground” a high-resistance one.
If the pan is buried deep enough in the earth, and bottom
up, it will last for several years, or so long as the air does
not get at it to induce corrosion.</p>

<p>The star-shaped “ground” is cut from a piece of sheet
zinc, copper, or brass, and is about twelve inches in diameter.
The wire is soldered to the middle of it, and it is
buried four feet deep, lying flat at the bottom of the hole.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FigXII16">Fig. 16</a> a pail or large tin can is shown with the wire
passing down through the interior and finally reaching the
bottom, where it is soldered fast. The can is filled with
small chunks of carbon, or charcoal, and some holes are
punched around the outer edge and bottom to let the water
out. The can is then buried three or four feet in the
ground. Use nothing but copper wire for “grounds,” and
it should be heavy&mdash;nothing smaller than No. 14. The
wire should be well insulated down to and below the surface
for a foot or two, so that perfect action will take place
and a complete “ground” secured.</p>

<h4>The Edison Roach-killer</h4>

<p>When Edison was a boy he invented the first electrocution
apparatus on record. At a certain station on the
Grand Trunk Railroad, where Edison was employed as a
telegraph operator, the roaches were so thick that at night
they would crawl up the partition between the windows<span class="pagenum" id="Page308">[308]</span>
and reach the ceiling, where they would go to sleep. During
the day they were apt to become dizzy, lose their footing,
and drop down on the heads of the operators. This did not
suit young Edison, so he devised a scheme for their destruction.
While watching a piece of telegraph apparatus
one day, he saw a roach try to step from a bar charged
with positive electricity to one through which a negative
current flowed. The insect’s feet were moist and so made
a connection between the two bars. As a consequence a
short-circuit of high tension passed through its body and it
dropped dead. This put an idea into Edison’s head, and
the electrocution apparatus was soon in working order.
The “killer” was the most simple device one could imagine,
and was composed of two long, narrow strips of heavy tin-foil
pasted side by side on a smooth board, with a space of
one-eighth of an inch between them, as shown at <a href="#FigXII17">Fig. 17</a>.
To one strip a positive wire was connected, while to the
other a negative or ground was made fast. High-tension
current, or that from an induction-coil, was connected with
the wires, and the resulting voltage was strong enough to
give one a severe shock if the fingers of one hand were placed
on one plate and those of the other hand on the other plate.</p>

<p>This device was arranged across the window-casing in
the path the roaches were accustomed to travel on their
nightly trips up the side wall. It was not long after dark
before roach number one sauntered up the wall, crossed the
under strip, and stepped over on the upper one. But he
went no farther, and he, with many of his friends and relations,
were gathered up in a dust-pan the next morning and
thrown into the stove.</p>

<p>In electricity, as in many other things, simplicity is the
key-note of success; and from this little device to employ
the alternating current for ridding a house of an insect
nuisance sprang the grim apparatus known as the “death
chair,” used in the execution of first-degree criminals in the
State of New York. Many people think the mechanism for
electrocution is a complicated one, but it is quite as simple
as the Edison roach-killer. One pole is placed at the head
of the criminal and the other at the feet, the latter being
bound fast so that perfect contact can be had. Then an alternating<span class="pagenum" id="Page310">[310]</span>
current of fifteen hundred to two thousand volts
is run through the body, and death is instantaneous and
void of pain.</p>

<h4>An Electric Mouse-killer</h4>

<p>A modification of the simple roach-killer was recently
used by the author in his laboratory to get rid of some
troublesome mice. A piece of board was cut twelve inches
square, the edges being bevelled so that it would be an easy
matter for the mice to climb up on it. An inch-wide circle
of sheet brass was prepared measuring eleven inches
outside diameter and nine inches inside. Another circle
was cut measuring eight inches and a half outside and six
inches inside diameter. Both circles were attached to the
board with copper tacks and polished as bright as possible,
the finished board appearing as shown in <a href="#FigXII18">Fig. 18</a>.</p>

<p>Wires were soldered to each strip, and these in turn were
connected to a high-tension current of several thousand
volts. Crumbs and small pieces of meat were placed on the
board inside the circles, and the trap was set in a convenient
place on the floor of the laboratory.</p>

<p>The next morning several mice lay dead on the floor, but
at some distance from the board, and this seemed a little
mysterious. The following night the author worked late
in the laboratory. After finishing what he had on hand,
he turned down the lights and sat down and watched the
trap. Presently Mr. Mouse appeared from somewhere.
He sniffed the air, then approached closer to the board,
sniffed again, and, evidently concluding that he was on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page311">[311]</span>
right trail, he climbed up the side of the board and stood
on the outer strip. He placed one fore-foot on the inner
strip, and, bang! up he went in the air, and landed on the
floor a foot or more away. His jump into space was due to
the electric action on his muscles, for the current literally
tore his nervous system into shreds.</p>

<p>Mr. Mouse lost a great many friends and relatives that
season in the same manner, and the apparatus is confidently
recommended as a certain and humane agent for the destruction
of all small vermin.</p>

<h3>Chapter XIII<br />
<span class="chaptitle">FRICTIONAL ELECTRICITY</span></h3>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">F</span><span class="afterlargecap">rictional</span>
electricity is high potential, current alternating,
and of high voltage but very low amperage.
Apart from certain uses in laboratory and medical practice,
it is valueless. In its greater volume it is akin to the lightning-bolt
and is dangerous; but in its smaller volume it is
a comparatively harmless toy. From the glass rod, or the
amber, rubbed on a catskin to the modern static machines
is a long jump, and the period of exploitation covers centuries
of interesting experiments, most of which, however,
have been practically useless for any commercial purpose.</p>

<p>Static or frictional electricity is generated by friction
only, without the aid of magnets, coils of wire, or armatures
rotating at high speed. The simple process of the
glass and catskin has been variously modified, until at last
Wimshurst invented and perfected what is known as the
“Wimshurst Influence Machine.” It is self-charging, and
does not require “starting.” It will work all the year
round in any climate and temperature, and is the greatest
improvement ever made in static electric machines.</p>

<p>Apart from its efficiency under all conditions, it is the
simplest of all machines to make, and can easily be constructed<span class="pagenum" id="Page313">[313]</span>
by a boy who is handy with tools, and who can
obtain the glass and brass parts necessary in its construction.
The principal parts of an influence machine are the
glass disks, wooden bosses, driving pulleys and crank, glass
standards, brass arms with the spark-balls at the ends, and
the base with the uprights on which these parts are built up
and held in position.</p>

<h4>A Wimshurst Influence Machine</h4>

<p>Obtain a stiff piece of brown paper twenty inches square,
and with a compass describe a circle twenty inches in diameter.
Inside of this circle make another one fourteen inches
in diameter, and near the centre a third circle six inches
in diameter. Another circle four inches in diameter should
be drawn inside of the six-inch circle, so that when the
bosses are made fast to the glass plates they can be properly
centred. Also mark sixteen lines radiating from the centre,
equal distances apart, as shown in <a href="#FigXIII1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>From a dealer in glass purchase two clear, white panes
of glass eighteen inches square. Be careful not to get the
green glass, as this is not nearly so good as the white for
static machine construction. If it is possible to get crystal
plate so much the better. The panes should be thin, or
about one-sixteenth of an inch in thickness, and free from
bubbles, wavy places, scratches, or other blemishes.</p>

<p>From these panes cut two disks sixteen inches in diameter
with a rotary cutter, as described in the chapter on Miscellaneous
Apparatus, <a href="#Page294">page 294</a>, and rub the edges with a
water-stone (see chapter on Formulæ, <a href="#Page330">page 330</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page314">[314]</span></p>

<p>From flat, thin tin-foil cut thirty-two wedge-shaped
pieces four inches long. They should be one inch and a
half wide at one end and three-quarters of an inch at the
other, as shown at <a href="#FigXIII2">Fig. 2</a> A. Give each plate of glass two
thin coats of shellac on both sides; then lay one on the
paper pattern (<a href="#FigXIII1">Fig. 1</a>) so that the outside edge of the glass
will lie on the largest circle. Place a weight at the middle
of the glass to hold it in place; then make sixteen of the
tin-foil sectors fast to the plate, using shellac as the sticking
medium. But first give one side of each sector a thin
coat of shellac, allowing it to dry; then give it another coat
when applying it to the glass. The sectors are to be symmetrically
arranged on the glass, using a line of the pattern
as a centre for each piece (as shown at A in <a href="#FigXIII1">Fig. 1</a>), and the
fourteen and six inch circles as the outer and inner boundaries.
Each piece, as it is applied, should be pressed down
upon the glass, so that it will stick smoothly, without air
bubbles or creases. A very good plan is to lay a piece of
soft blotting-paper over the sector and drive it down with
a small squeegee-roller such as is used in photography, taking
care, however, not to shift the sector from its proper position.
When all the sectors are on, the plate should appear
as shown in <a href="#FigXIII2">Fig. 2</a>. After the shellac, which holds the
sectors to the glass, is dry, run a brush full of shellac around
the inner and outer extremities of the tin-foil strips for half
or three-quarters of an inch in from the ends. The shellac
will hold the sectors firmly to the glass, and will slightly
insulate them as well, thereby preventing the escape of
electricity. Apply the remaining sectors to the other plate
of glass in a similar manner; and as a result two disks of
glass, with the applied strips, will be ready to mount in
the frame.</p>

<p>A hole three-quarters of an inch in diameter should be
made in each glass plate, so that a three-eighths spindle may
pass through them and into the bosses, so as to keep them

holes if bosses and accurately bushed holes can be made

<p>At a wood-working mill have two bosses made that will
measure four inches in diameter at the large end, and one
inch and a half at the small one. They should be of such
length that when the plates and two bosses are arranged
in line (to appear as shown in A A at <a href="#FigXIII9">Fig. 9</a>) they will fill
the entire space between the uprights B B. Near the small
end a groove is turned in each boss, so that a round leather
belt will fit in it, as shown in <a href="#FigXIII3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p>The base is made from pine, white-wood, cypress, or any
other wood that is soft and easily worked. It is composed
of two strips twenty-four inches long, three inches wide,
and one inch and a quarter in thickness, and two cross-pieces
fourteen inches long, three inches wide, and one inch
and a half thick.</p>

<p>These are put together with glue and screws, and at both
sides of the base notches are cut to accommodate the feet
of the uprights. The uprights are seventeen inches high,
three inches wide, and one inch and a half thick. The
notch at the foot of each one is cut so that, when fitted in
place, the foot of the upright will rest on a table on a line
with the bottom of the end cross-pieces under each corner.
At the foot of the uprights a piece of sheet rubber should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page317">[317]</span>
made fast, with glue or shellac, so that when in operation
the machine will not move about or slide.</p>

<p>A groove is cut at one side of each upright six inches
above the bottom, as shown at <a href="#FigXIII4">Fig. 4</a> A. In this groove
the driving-wheel axles fit, and near the top holes are made
in the uprights through which the spindles pass, which in
turn support the bosses and glass disks.</p>

<p>At the middle of each cross-piece forming the ends of
the base a one-inch hole, for the glass standard rods, is
bored through the wood, as shown at <a href="#FigXIII4">Fig. 4</a> B B. After
attaching the uprights to the base with glue and screws,
and giving all the wood-work several successive coats of
shellac, the frame will be ready for its mountings.</p>

<p>The driving-wheels are of wood seven-eighths of an inch
thick and seven inches in diameter; they should be turned
on a lathe and a groove cut in the edge so that a round
leather belt will fit in it. These wheels are mounted on a
wooden axle that can be made from a round curtain-pole,
with a half-inch hole bored through its entire length. The
axle is as long as the distance between uprights B B in
<a href="#FigXIII9">Fig. 9</a>. The wheels are to be arranged and glued fast to
the axle, so that the grooves will line directly under those
in the bosses, as shown in <a href="#FigXIII9">Fig. 9</a>. A half-inch axle is
driven through the hub, and at one end it is threaded and
provided with two washers and nuts; or a square shoulder
and one washer and nut may be used, so that a crank and
handle may be held fast. Shellac should be put on the
shaft to make it hold fast in the hub.</p>

<p>The complete apparatus of wheels, axle, hub, and handle
is shown at <a href="#FigXIII5">Fig. 5</a>, and in the frame this is so hung that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page318">[318]</span>
iron axle rests in the grooves cut in the uprights. To hold
this in place two metal straps, as shown in <a href="#FigXIII6">Fig. 6</a>, are made
and screwed fast to the wood. When finally adjusted the
driving-wheels should rotate freely whenever the crank is
turned. The wooden bosses, <a href="#FigXIII3">Fig. 3</a>, are given two or three
coats of shellac; then they are made fast to the glass disks
on the same side to which the tin-foil sectors are attached.
The disks should be placed over the paper plan, <a href="#FigXIII1">Fig. 1</a>,
and so adjusted that the outer line tallies with the large
circle. Acetic glue<a id="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is then applied to the flat surface of
the boss, and the latter is placed at the middle of the disk
to line with the small circle. Place a weight on the end of
the boss to hold it down, and leave it for ten or twelve
hours or until thoroughly dry.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote4"></a><a href="#FNanchor4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
See <a href="#Page327">Formulæ, Chapter xiv.</a>, for the recipe of <a href="#Ref006">acetic glue</a>.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Both bosses should be set at the same time so that they
may dry together.</p>

<p>If the bosses are turned on a lathe a hole should be made
in each one about half-way through from the small end.
This, in turn, should be bushed or lined with a piece of
brass tube, which should fit snugly in the hole. A little
shellac painted on each piece of tube will make it stick.
Pieces of steel rod that will just fit within the tubing are
to be cut long enough to enter the full length of the hole,
pass through the holes made in the top of the uprights, and
extend half an inch beyond, as shown in <a href="#FigXIII9">Fig. 9</a>. The bosses
and axles will then appear as shown in <a href="#FigXIII7">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<p>Flat places should be filed on each rod where it passes
through the wood upright; a set-screw will then hold it<span class="pagenum" id="Page319">[319]</span>
fast and keep it from revolving. When the hole, or tubing,
is oiled so that the boss and disk will revolve freely on the
axle, the disks, bosses, and axles are ready to be mounted
in the frame.</p>

<p>A red fibre washer, such as is used in faucets, should be
made fast to one glass disk at the centre, so as to separate
the disks and prevent them from touching when they are
revolving in opposite directions. These fibre washers can
be had from a plumber or purchased at a hardware store.
Shellac or acetic glue will hold the washers in place.</p>

<p>Mount one disk by holding the boss with the small end
opposite a hole in one upright, and slip an axle through
from the outside of the upright. Hold the other disk in
place, and slip the remaining axle through the other upright<span class="pagenum" id="Page320">[320]</span>
and into the boss. When both plates are in place
and centred, turn the set-screws down on the flattened axles
to hold them in place.</p>

<p>To reduce the friction between the bosses and the uprights
it would be well to place a fibre washer between
them. A few drops of oil on these washers will lubricate
them properly, and allow the machine to run easier. An
end view of the apparatus, as so far assembled, will appear
as shown in <a href="#FigXIII9">Fig. 9</a>, A being the disks, bosses, and axles,
B B the uprights supporting them, C the hub, and D D
the driving-wheels. The handle and crank (E) extends out
far enough from the side to allow a free swinging motion
without hitting the upright or base. Having arranged these
disks and wheels so as to revolve freely, it will now be
necessary to construct and add the other vital parts and
the connecting links in the chain of the complete working
mechanism.</p>

<p>From a supply-house obtain two solid glass rods an inch
in diameter and fifteen inches long. These fit in the holes
(B B) bored in the end-pieces of the base, <a href="#FigXIII4">Fig. 4</a>. Procure
two brass balls, two or two and a half inches in diameter,
such as come on brass beds, and two short pieces of brass
tubing, one inch inside diameter, that will fit over the ends
of the rods. These tubings are to be soldered fast to the
balls so that both tubes and balls will remain at the top
of the glass rods.</p>

<p>From brass rod three-sixteenths or a quarter of an inch
in diameter make two forks, as shown at <a href="#FigXIII8">Fig. 8</a>, and solder
small brass balls at the ends of the rods. The prongs of
the fork are six inches long and the shank four inches in<span class="pagenum" id="Page321">[321]</span>
length. Along the inside of the forks small holes are bored,
and brass wires, or “points,” are soldered fast. These extend
out for half an inch from the rods, and are known as
the “comb,” or collectors. The forks should be so far apart
that when mounted with the glass disks revolving between
them the points will not touch or scratch the tin-foil sectors,
and yet be as close to them as possible. A hole should be
bored in the brass balls, and the shank of the fork passed
through and soldered in place, as shown in <a href="#FigXIII10">Fig. 10</a>.</p>

<p>A three-eighth-inch hole is bored directly in the top of
each brass ball to hold the quadrant rods, which extend
over the top of the disks.</p>

<p>In the illustration of the complete machine (<a href="#FigXIII12">Fig. 12</a>) the
arrangement of the glass pillars, balls, combs, and quadrant
rods is shown. The rods are three-eighths of an inch in
diameter and are loose in the holes at the top of the balls,
so that they can be moved or shifted about, according as to
whether it is a left or a right handed person who may be
turning the crank.</p>

<p>At the upper end of each rod a brass ball is soldered, one
being three-quarters of an inch in diameter, the other two
inches. The projecting ends of the forks should be provided
with metal handles or brass balls, as shown in <a href="#FigXIII12">Fig. 12</a>;
these may be slipped over the end or soldered fast. Obtain
two small brass balls with shanks, such as screw on iron
bed-posts, and have the extending ends of the axles that
support the bosses threaded, so that the balls will screw
on them. Bore a quarter-inch hole through each ball, and
slip a brass rod through it and solder it fast. Each end of
these rods should be tipped with a bunch of tinsel or fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page322">[322]</span>
copper wires. These are the “neutralizers,” and the ends
are curved so that the brushes of fine wires will just touch
the disks when the latter are revolved, as shown in <a href="#FigXIII12">Fig. 12</a>.
The ball holding the rod is to be screwed fast to the axle;
then the axle is pushed back into the boss and made fast
in the head of the upright with the set-screw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page323">[323]</span></p>

<p>The rod-and-ball at the opposite side of the disks is
arranged in a similar manner, but the rod points in an
opposite direction to that on the first side. Cord or leather
belts connect the driving-pulleys and bosses, the belt on
one side running up straight over the boss and down again
around the driving-pulley. The belt at the opposite side
is crossed, so that the direction of the boss is reversed; and
in this manner the disks are made to revolve in opposite
directions, although the driving-pulleys are both going in
the same direction.</p>

<p>A portion of the sectors are omitted in the illustration
(<a href="#FigXIII12">Fig. 12</a>) so that a better view of the working parts may be
had. When the disks are revolving the accumulated electricity
discharges from one ball to the other, above the
plates, in the form of bright blue sparks sufficiently powerful
to puncture cardboard if it is held midway between
the balls.</p>

<h4>A Large Leyden-jar</h4>

<p>When experimenting with this machine it would be well
to have one or more Leyden-jars to accumulate static
charges. A large one of considerable capacity is easily
made from a battery jar, tin-foil, brass rods and chain, and
some other small parts.</p>

<p>Obtain a bluestone battery jar, and after heating it to
drive all moisture from the surface, give it a coat of shellac
inside and out. With tin-foil, set with shellac, cover the
bottom and inside of the jar for two-thirds of its height
from the bottom, as shown in <a href="#FigXIII11">Fig. 11</a>. Cover the outside
and bottom in a similar manner, and the same height from<span class="pagenum" id="Page324">[324]</span>
the bottom, and provide a cork, or wooden cap, for the top.
If a large, flat cork cannot be had, then make a stopper
by cutting two circular pieces of wood, each half an inch
thick, the inner one to fit snugly within the jar, the other
to lap over the edges a quarter of an inch all around. Fasten
these pieces together with glue, as shown at <a href="#FigXIII13">Fig. 13</a>,
and give them several good coats of shellac. Make a small
hole at the middle of this cap and pass a quarter-inch rod
through it, leaving six inches above and below the cap.
To the top of the rod solder a brass ball. At the foot a piece
of brass chain is to be made fast, so that several links of it
rest on the tin-foil at the bottom of the jar.</p>

<p>To charge a jar from the Wimshurst machine, stand the
jar on a glass-legged stool, and connect a copper wire between
one of the overhead balls on the machine and the ball
at the top of the rod in the stopper of the jar. Make another
wire fast to the other ball at the top of the machine,
and place it under the jar so that the tin-foil on the bottom
touches it. By operating the machine the jar is charged.</p>

<p>To discharge the jar make a <span class="symbol">T</span>-yoke, as shown at <a href="#FigXIII14">Fig. 14</a>,
by nailing a brass rod fast to a wooden handle and soldering
brass knobs, or hammering a lead bullet, on the ends of the
rod. Hold one knob against the top knob of the jar and
bring the other near the foil coating at the outside, when
a spark will jump from the foil to the knob with a loud
snap.</p>

<h4>A Glass-legged Stool</h4>

<p>One of the most useful accessories in playing with frictional
electricity will be a glass-legged stool. A stool with<span class="pagenum" id="Page325">[325]</span>
glass feet is perhaps too expensive for a boy to purchase,
but one may be made at little or no cost from a piece of
stout plank, four glass telegraph line-insulators, and the
wooden screw-pins on which they rest when attached to a
pole.</p>

<div class="container m40">
<a id="FigXIII11"></a>

<a id="FigXIII16"></a>

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo325.jpg" alt="Leyden jar and glass stool" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The general plan of the stool is shown at <a href="#FigXIII15">Fig. 15</a>, and
the top measures twelve by fifteen by two inches. Under
each corner a screw-pin is made fast by boring a hole in<span class="pagenum" id="Page326">[326]</span>
the wood and setting the pin in glue. The pins are cut
at the top, as shown in <a href="#FigXIII16">Fig. 16</a>, and when they are set in
place the glass insulators may be screwed on. The wood-work
should be given a few coats of shellac to lend it a good
appearance and help to insulate it.</p>

<p>There are a great many interesting experiments that
may be performed with static or frictional electricity, and
these may be looked up in the text-books on electricity
used in school. A word of caution will not be misplaced.
Remember that the current, in large volume, is dangerous.
For example, a series of charged Leyden-jars may contain
enough electricity to give a very severe shock to the nervous
system of the person who chances to discharge it. Its
medical use should be under the advice and supervision of
a physician.</p>

<h3>Chapter XIV<br />
<span class="chaptitle">FORMULÆ</span></h3>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">I</span><span class="afterlargecap">n</span>
the construction of electrical apparatus there are
many things, such as paint, cement, non-conducting compounds,
and acid-proof substances, that are necessary in
assembling the parts which make up complete working
outfits. Accurate formulas and directions for these things
will save the amateur trouble and expense, since they indicate
the materials which have been put to the test of time
and wear by others who have had abundant experience
along these lines.</p>

<p>The amateur will not need a large number of compounds,
but such as are necessary should be of the best. Those
which are described in this chapter can be relied upon to
give working results.</p>

<h4>Acid-proof Cements</h4>

<p>One of the best acid-proof cements is made by adding
shellac, dissolved in grain alcohol, to red-lead until it is at
the right consistency. It can be used in liquid form or
in a putty-like paste. The consistency is governed by the
amount of shellac added to the red-lead. The lead should
be pulverized and free from lumps. This cement can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page328">[328]</span>
mixed in a small tin cup or on a piece of glass, with a knife
having a thin blade.</p>

<p>It should be used as soon as it is mixed, since it “sets”
as quickly as shellac, and then dries from the outside towards
the middle. In a week or two it will become dry
and hard like stone.</p>

<p>Another cement, which will also dry as hard as a stone
and will hold soapstone slabs together as if they were of
one solid piece, is made of litharge (yellow lead) and glycerine.
The glycerine is added to the pulverized litharge
to make a paste, or it can be mixed and kneaded like thin
putty. It should be used very soon after mixing, as it sets
rapidly.</p>

<h4>Hard Cement</h4>

<p>A medium hard cement is made from plaster of Paris,
six parts; silex, or fine sand, two parts; dextrine, two parts
(by measure). Mix with water until soft; then work with
a trowel or knife.</p>

<h4>Soft Cement</h4>

<p>A good soft cement is made of plaster of Paris, five parts;
pulverized asbestos, five parts (by weight). Add water
enough to make a soft paste, and use with a trowel or knife.
This is a heat-proof compound and is commonly known as
asbestos cement.</p>

<h4>Very Hard Cement</h4>

<p>One of the hardest cements that can be made is composed
of hydraulic cement (Portland or Edison), five parts;<span class="pagenum" id="Page329">[329]</span>
silex, or white sand, five parts (by measure). Mix with
water and use like plaster with a trowel or spatula.</p>

<p>Care must be taken when the parts are combined to see
that the cement is free from lumps. These must be broken
before the silex, or sand, and water are added. Then the
two parts should be mixed together at first and moistened
afterwards. The proper way is to place some water at the
bottom of a pan; then add the dry mixture by the handfuls,
sprinkling it around so that the water can enter into
it without forming lumps. Keep adding and mixing until
the mass is at the right consistency to work.</p>

<p>All these cements are acid-proof.</p>

<h4>Clark’s Compound</h4>

<p>For exterior insulation, where the parts are exposed to
the weather, a superior compound is made up of mineral
pitch, ten parts; silica, six parts; tar, one part (all parts by
weight). This is called Clark’s compound, after the man
who invented it and used it successfully.</p>

<p>It is heated, thoroughly mixed, and used with a brush
or spatula.</p>

<h4>Battery Fluid</h4>

<p>A depolarizing solution for use in zinc-carbon batteries
like the Grenet is composed as follows:</p>

<p>Dissolve one pound of bichromate potash or soda in ten
pounds of water (by weight). When it is thoroughly dissolved
add two and one-half pounds of sulphuric acid,
slowly pouring it into the bichromate solution and stirring<span class="pagenum" id="Page330">[330]</span>
it with a glass rod. The addition of the acid will heat the
solution. Do not use it until it has entirely cooled.</p>

<h4>Glass Rubbing</h4>

<p>To rub the edges of glass, such as the disks for Wimshurst
machines, obtain a piece of hard sandstone, such as is used
for sharpening knives or scythes. The glass is placed on a
table so that the edge extends beyond. Oil of turpentine
is rubbed or dropped on the surface of the stone, and the
edge of the glass is moistened with a rag soaked in the turpentine.
Hold the glass down securely with one hand, and
with the other grasp the stone and give it a forward and
backward motion, grinding the glass along its edge and not
crosswise. With care and patience a rough edge can soon
be brought to a smooth one, and a soft, rounded corner substituted
for the hard, angular, cutting edge that makes the
glass a difficult thing to handle. Use plenty of lubricant in
the form of oil of turpentine to make the work easy.</p>

<h4 id="Ref006">Acetic Glue</h4>

<p>One of the best glues for glass and wood or glass and
fibre is made by placing some high-grade glue (either flake
or granulated) in a cup or tin and covering it with cold
water. Allow it to stand several hours until the glue absorbs
all the water it will and becomes soft; then pour the
water off, and add glacial acetic acid to cover the glue. The
proportion should be eighteen parts of glue to two of acid.
Heat the mass until it is reduced to liquid, stirring it until<span class="pagenum" id="Page331">[331]</span>
it is thoroughly mixed. When ready for use it should be
poured into a bottle and well corked to keep the air away
from it.</p>

<h4>Insulators</h4>

<p>Apart from glass and porcelain, insulators can be made
from non-conducting compounds, the best of which is
molded mica. Ground mica or mica dust is mixed with
thick shellac until it is in a putty-like state. It may then
be forced into oiled molds of any desired shape. Hydraulic
pressure is employed for almost every form of molded
mica that is made for commercial purposes; but as a boy
cannot employ that means to get the best results, he must
use all the pressure that his hands and a flat board will
give.</p>

<p>Another compound is made from pulverized asbestos
and shellac, with a small portion of ground or pulverized
mica added, in the proportion of asbestos, six parts; mica,
four parts. Shellac is added to make a pasty mass, which
is kneaded into a thick putty and forced into oiled molds
until it sets. It is then removed and allowed to dry in the
open air, and the mold used for more insulators.</p>

<h4>Non-conductors</h4>

<p>When working in different materials that seem adapted
to electrical apparatus, it is necessary to know whether they
can be used safely or not. Often a material seems to be
just the thing, but if it should be a partial conductor, when
a non-conductor is desired, it would be hazardous to use<span class="pagenum" id="Page332">[332]</span>
it. A list of non-conductors is therefore valuable to the
amateur. Some of the principal non-conductors, among
the many, are as follows: glass, porcelain, slate, marble,
hard stone, soapstone, concrete (dry), hard rubber, soft rubber,
composition fibre, mica, asbestos, pitch, tar, shellac,
cotton, silk; cotton, silk and woollen fabrics, transite (dry),
electrobestus (dry), duranoid; celluloid, dry wood (well seasoned),
paper, pith, leather, and oil.</p>

<p>While this account of formulæ and material might be extended,
this is not necessary inasmuch as the formulæ and
practical directions which have been given will answer all
usual practical requirements.</p>

<h4>Insulating Varnish</h4>

<p>There are several good insulating varnishes that can be
used in electrical work, the most valuable being shellac dissolved
in alcohol and applied with a brush. To make good
shellac, purchase the orange-colored flake shellac by the
pound from a paint-store, place some of it in a wide-necked
bottle, and cover it with alcohol; then cork the bottle and
let it stand for a few hours. Shake the bottle occasionally
until the shellac is thoroughly dissolved. It can be thinned
by adding alcohol. Always keep the bottle corked, taking
out only what is necessary from time to time.</p>

<p>Another varnish can be made by dissolving red sealing-wax
in alcohol and adding a small portion of shellac. This
can be applied with a soft brush, and is a good varnish.
When colors are to be applied to distinguish the poles, red<span class="pagenum" id="Page333">[333]</span>
is used for the positive current-poles and blue or black for
the negative, if they are colored at all.</p>

<p>A very good black varnish is made by adding lampblack
to shellac; another consists of thick asphaltum or asphaltum
varnish. This is waterproof, and dries hard, yet with
an elastic finish.</p>

<h4>Battery Wax</h4>

<p>For the upper edges of glass cells, such as the Leclanché
or other open-circuit batteries, there is nothing superior to
hot paraffine brushed about the upper edge to prevent the
sal-ammoniac or other fluids from creeping up over the top.
The paraffine can be colored with red-lead, green dust, or
powders of various colors if desired, but generally the paraffine
is used without color, so that it has a frosted-glass appearance
when it is cool and dry.</p>

<p>A black wax for use in stopping the tops of dry cells
and coating the tops of carbons is composed of paraffine,
eight parts; pitch, one part; lampblack, one part.
Heat the mixture and stir it until thoroughly mixed;
then apply with a brush, or dip the parts into the warm
fluid.</p>

<p>Another good black wax is composed of tar and pitch in
equal parts. They are made into a pasty mass with turpentine
heated over a stove, but not over an open flame,
because the ingredients are inflammable. The compound
should be like very thick molasses, and can be worked with
an old table-knife.</p>

the discovery of the reversibility of the dynamo,
the invention of the telephone, and the improvements
in the electric light began the great modern development
of electricity which proved that marvellous agent to be a
master-workman.</p>

<p>Many of the things electrical that we ordinarily think of
as modern inventions are merely modern applications of
phenomena that were discovered many years ago. The
pioneers in the science of dynamic electricity performed
their experiments with the electric light, electro-magnets,
etc., by using galvanic batteries. But for practical purposes
the consuming of zinc and chemicals in such batteries
was too expensive a way to generate electricity, and prevented
any commercial use of the results of their experiments
until cheaper electricity could be had.</p>

<h4>The Work of the Dynamo</h4>

<p>The invention of the dynamo, with which we obtain electricity
from mechanical power, changed all that. Instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page335">[335]</span>
of consuming zinc in primary batteries, men could obtain it
by burning coal, which is much cheaper, under the boiler of a
steam-engine used to drive the dynamo. Thus it is that
modern electricity comes from mechanical power. It is
really the energy of a steam-engine or a water-wheel, or some
other “prime mover,” working through the medium of
electricity, that is transmitted to a distance and distributed
over wires. The electricity may then be transmuted into
light, heat, or chemical energy as the case may be, to light
our electric lamps, develop the intense heat of the electric
furnace, and charge storage-batteries.</p>

<p>Moreover, some time after the invention of the dynamo
it was found that the mechanical power put into one of
these machines could be transmitted electrically and reproduced
as mechanical power. In other words, a dynamo
could be made to revolve and give out power, as a motor,
by supplying it with current from another dynamo. This
showed the way to transmute electricity back again into
mechanical power, to run our electric cars and trains, and
all kinds of machinery in our factories and elsewhere. Nowadays
the dynamo is used to generate nearly all the electricity
that we need. Even in such comparatively old
electrical applications as electro-plating and the telegraph
and telephone, primary batteries are being supplanted
by motor dynamos, which we shall learn about
later.</p>

<p>It is from the invention of the dynamo and the discovery
that it was reversible that we date the beginning of what are
known as heavy electrical engineering applications, including
electric light, heat, and power. In this closing chapter it<span class="pagenum" id="Page336">[336]</span>
is purposed to learn a little about these applications, and in
so doing to summarize briefly the things that we have already
studied.</p>

<h4>The Electric Light</h4>

<p>In the <a href="#Page125">chapter</a> on Electrical Resistance we learned that
an electric current always encounters a resistance in passing
through a conductor, and that when the current is strong
enough the conductor is heated up. The electric light is
produced by the heating of a conductor of one kind or another
to incandescence by the electrical friction of the current
passing through it.</p>

<p>The first electric light was made by Sir Humphry Davy
over a hundred years ago. He discovered that when a
current from a great many cells of battery was interrupted
the spark did not simply appear for an instant and
then go out, as it does when only a few cells are used, but
remained playing between the terminals of the circuit. He
found by experiment that if pieces of carbon are used as
the terminals&mdash;or “electrodes,” as they are called&mdash;the
electricity passes between them in an intensely hot flame,
or “arc.” The latter, which is due to the electrical resistance
of the vapor of carbon, heats up the carbon-points
so that they give a brilliant white light.</p>

<p>Before the dynamo came into use, the electric light was
rarely seen, except as a philosophical experiment; but as
soon as cheap electricity became available, commercial
electric arc-lamps were made by many inventors and have
been continually improved. <a href="#FigXV1">Fig. 1</a> shows one form of modern
arc-lamp, with its case removed to show the interior
mechanism. In most arc-lamps the lamp itself consists of
a pair of carbon or other electrodes in the form of long rods
arranged vertically, with their tips normally in contact.
When the current is turned on, the mechanism lifts the upper
electrode away from the lower one. The interruption of
the circuit thus caused “strikes the arc” between the tips,<span class="pagenum" id="Page338">[338]</span>
and the mechanism keeps the arc-distance unchanged as the
carbons burn away. Some arc-lamps are made to burn on
continuous-current, and others on alternating-current circuits.
When continuous current is used, the upper (or
positive) carbon burns away about twice as fast as the lower
one, forming a cup, or “crater,” from which most of the
light comes.</p>

<h4>Uses of the Arc-Light</h4>

<p>The first commercial use of the arc-light on a large scale
was for street-lighting, to replace the old-fashioned gas-lamps.
But another important use is in search-lights, in
which the arc-lamp is fitted with a powerful reflector for
throwing a very bright light to a distance. <a href="#FigXV2">Fig. 2</a> is a view
of a search-light arranged to go on top of a ship’s pilot-house.
In war-time the ships carry search-lights to help them find
the enemy’s ships and repel attack; and they are used in the
army also, by having a portable dynamo and engine drawn
by horses. The arc is also employed in projectors for lecture-rooms,
and sometimes for the headlights of steam and
electric locomotives and interurban electric cars.</p>

<h4>Incandescent and Other Lamps</h4>

<p>The arc-lamp came into wide use for lighting large spaces
like streets, stores, and public halls, but was found to be too
intense for lighting smaller places like private houses. After
many experiments, Edison succeeded in subdividing the
electric light into the small pear-shaped “incandescent”
lamps that we now see everywhere. In this kind of electric<span class="pagenum" id="Page339">[339]</span>
lamp the light comes from a thin “filament” of carbon, contained
in a glass globe from which all air has been removed.
Since there is no oxygen to support combustion, the filament
may be heated white-hot by the current without being
consumed.</p>

<div class="container m40" id="FigXV3">

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo339.jpg" alt="Lamp" />
</div>

<p class="caption"><b><i><span class="sstype">Fig. 3</span></i></b></p>

</div><!--cotainer-->

<p>In certain other forms of incandescent lamps that are
just coming into use, the filaments are made of rare metals&mdash;osmium,
tantalum, etc.&mdash;that will stand a high temperature<span class="pagenum" id="Page340">[340]</span>
without melting. The Nernst lamp has a filament
consisting of a mixture of certain materials that has to be
heated before it will conduct electricity.</p>

<p>Then there are the so-called “vapor” lamps, consisting of
a glass tube full of conducting metallic vapor which gives
out light when a current is passed through it. The best-known
form is the Cooper Hewitt mercury vapor-lamp
shown in <a href="#FigXV3">Fig. 3</a>, which gives a peculiar greenish light.</p>

<p>From the point of view of efficiency, the electric light,
wonderful as it is, leaves much to be desired. The light
always comes from a hot resistance; and whether this resistance
is a mass of conducting vapor, as in the arc and
vapor lamps, or a solid conducting filament, as in the so-called
“incandescent” lamps, much more heat than light
is produced. A needed improvement, therefore, is in the
direction of obtaining a greater percentage of light for a
given amount of electrical energy.</p>

<h4>Electric Heat</h4>

<p>The generation of heat in electrical devices usually means
wasted energy&mdash;sometimes a very serious waste, as we have
just seen. There are certain kinds of electrical apparatus,
however, that are designed to transform all of the electrical
energy delivered to them into heat, for various industrial
and household purposes.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h4>Electric Furnaces</h4>

<p>By far the most important application of electric heat, as
such, is in electric furnaces, by means of which we attain the<span class="pagenum" id="Page341">[341]</span>
highest temperatures known to man. The electric furnace
consists of a chamber of “refractory” material, containing
the substances to be acted upon by the heat, with a pair of
big carbon electrodes thrust into the centre, as shown in
<a href="#FigXV4">Fig. 4</a>, which is a picture of Moissan’s electric furnace for
the distillation of metals, and supplied with heavy continuous
or alternating currents. The apparatus is therefore a
sort of gigantic electric arc-lamp, so enclosed that the whole
of the intense heat of the arc is confined and concentrated
on the smelting or other work. In many places where cheap
electric power is to be had&mdash;as in the vicinity of the great
Niagara Falls power-plants&mdash;electric furnaces are employed
in what are known as electrometallurgical and electrochemical<span class="pagenum" id="Page342">[342]</span>
manufacturing processes. By their aid many metals and
other substances that were formerly scientific curiosities, or
entirely unknown, are produced commercially; such as aluminum,
certain rare metals, and calcium carbide, from
which that wonderful illuminant, acetylene-gas, is obtained.</p>

<h4>Welding Metals</h4>

<p>Another useful application of electric heat is in the welding
of metals. Instead of heating the pieces to be welded
in a forge, their ends are simply butted together and the
electricity&mdash;generally from an alternating-current transformer&mdash;turned
on. The heat developed by the “contact
resistance” between the pieces quickly softens the metal so
that the pieces may be forced together, forming a perfect
weld in a few minutes without any hammering. <a href="#FigXV5">Fig. 5</a> is
a view of one form of electric welding-machine in which this
is accomplished. The electric process can weld certain
metals that cannot be joined securely by ordinary welding
methods, and is used in several special arts.</p>

<p>Welding is also performed by the heat of a special electric
arc-lamp, which a workman holds in his hand like a blow-pipe
or torch. This process is especially useful in joining the
edges of sheet-steel, in making tanks for electric “transformers,”
etc. The workmen have to wear smoked glasses
in order to protect their eyes from the intense glare of the
arc.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h4>Electric Car-heaters</h4>

<p>Perhaps the simplest and best-known application of electric
heat is the electric car-heater, consisting of coils of high-resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page343">[343]</span>
wire&mdash;such as iron or German-silver wire&mdash;mounted
on an insulating, non-combustible frame which is placed
under the seats of the car. Part of the current from the
trolley wire or third rail passes through the resistance-coils,
heating them up and thereby warming the air in the
car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page344">[344]</span></p>

<h4>Household Uses</h4>

<p>Nowadays electric heat is being more and more widely
utilized in what are known as household electric heating-appliances.
One of the most useful of these is the electric
flat-iron, shown in <a href="#FigXV6">Fig. 6</a>. This flat-iron is designed to do
away with the use of a hot stove of any kind, and is internally
heated by means of a resistance-coil of peculiar shape
placed in the bottom of the iron close against its working
face. The iron is connected to an electric-light socket by
means of an attaching plug on the end of a long, flexible
cord. It takes only a few minutes to get hot, and its use
saves much time and labor.</p>

<p>The list of special heating-appliances that are now made
includes curling-iron heaters; heating-pads, for taking the
place of hot-water bags in the sick-room; cigar-lighters, in
which a little grid “resistance” is made incandescent by
pressing a button; foot-warmers; and radiators to dry wet
shoes or skirts on rainy days. For industrial use there are
glue-pots, for bookbinders and pattern-makers; large flat-irons,
for tailor-shops and laundries; and electric ovens, for
drying certain parts of electrical machines and for cooking
various kinds of “prepared foods.”</p>

<p>Many electric cooking-utensils are made for the household,
such as coffee-percolators, egg-boilers, ovens, disk stoves, etc.
Each one is equipped with a resistance-coil like that in the
electric flat-iron just described, so that it contains its own
source of heat, which is under perfect control by means of a
switch. An “electric kitchen” consists of a number of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page345">[345]</span>
utensils, wired to a convenient table or stand, as shown in
<a href="#FigXV7">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<h4>Electric Power</h4>

<p>We have seen that the modern way to generate electricity
is from mechanical energy applied through a dynamo, and
that the “electric power” thus generated may be transmitted
over wires to a distance and there transformed into
other forms of energy, such as light, heat, and chemical energy,
or reproduced again as mechanical energy. The last
mentioned of these transformations is the most important of
them all, because it is the one that means the most for the
advancement of civilization. Before the invention of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page346">[346]</span>
dynamo and the discovery that it was reversible, mechanical
power could be employed only in the place where it was
generated, so that its use was restricted; whereas nowadays
the field of power is broadened and its cost reduced by
electrical transmission and distribution.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#Page229">chapter</a> on Dynamos and Motors we learned how to
make and use those machines. Let us review, very briefly,
just what happens in the double transformation&mdash;of mechanical
energy into electricity and then back again at the
end of a line of wires&mdash;that we call electric-power transmission.
In the dynamo, the power of the water-wheel, or
whatever other prime mover is used, is exerted in generating
electricity by forcing the electric conductors of the machine
through a magnetic field. The electricity is led away to a
distance&mdash;a hundred miles, perhaps&mdash;by wires and allowed
to enter another machine similar to the dynamo, but operating
as a motor. Here the first process is reversed: the electricity
passing through the conductors of the motor reacts
upon its magnetic field, causing the machine to revolve and
thus generating mechanical power again. The line-wires
carry the power just as positively as though a long shaft ran
from the prime mover to the receiving end of the line, and
much more economically. The action that goes on is
similar to the operation of the telephone&mdash;which is indeed a
special case of electric-power transmission&mdash;as already explained
in a former chapter: the sound of the voice being
transformed, at the telephone-transmitter, into electrical
energy in the form of alternating currents, then carried
as such over the line and finally reproduced as sound again
at the receiver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page347">[347]</span></p>

<h4>Power from Water-wheels</h4>

<p>“Hydro-electric” transmissions&mdash;i. e., electric transmissions
of power from a water-wheel as prime mover&mdash;are the
most important because they bring into use cheap water-power
that formerly ran to waste. There are many hydro-electric
transmissions in this country, Mexico, and Canada,
some of them utilizing the power of waterfalls or rapids
located in mountainous and inaccessible parts. The alternating
current is nearly always used because by it men
can much more easily and safely generate, transmit, and
receive the high voltages that have to be used than by the
continuous current. The machinery at the “main generating
station” consists of big alternating-current dynamos,
which sometimes have vertical shafts instead of horizontal
ones, so that they may be driven directly by turbines.
The current is generated at a moderate potential, which
is then “stepped-up,” by “static transformers,” to the
comparatively high-line voltage that is required in long-distance
transmissions.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h4>Transformers</h4>

<p><a href="#FigXV8">Fig. 8</a> is a view of a very large transformer of over 2500
electrical horse-power capacity. In the picture the containing-tank
is represented as transparent, so as to show the
transformer proper inside. The latter is really a special kind
of induction-coil, with primary and secondary windings, and
a core, weighing many tons, built up of thin sheets of steel.
In this kind of transformer, the tank is filled with oil, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page348">[348]</span>
keep the transformer cool in operation, and to help insulate
it against the high potential to which it is subjected. At
the receiving end, or “sub-station,” the high-voltage electric<span class="pagenum" id="Page349">[349]</span>
power enters a set of “step-down” transformers, from which
it is delivered again, at moderate potential, to the motors.</p>

<p>Sometimes power is distributed from a single great generating
station to several sub-stations. In the Necaxa
transmission, in Mexico, over 35,000 horse-power is taken
from a waterfall in the mountains and transmitted at 60,000
volts potential to Mexico City, 100 miles away, and
to the mining town of El Oro, seventy-four miles farther
on.</p>

<p>Several kinds of motors are used at the receiving end of
electric-power transmission-lines, according to the work that
they are called upon to do. For “stationary” work, like
driving the machines in mills and factories, two principal
kinds of alternating-current motors are employed&mdash;synchronous
and induction motors. The former are built just
like alternating-current dynamos, and when they are running
they keep “in step” with the dynamo at the other end
of the line; i. e., the motion of their field windings relatively
to their armatures keeps exact pace with the same motion
at the dynamo, just as though a long shaft ran from one
machine to the other instead of the electric wires of the transmission-line.
A motor of this type, at work driving an air-compressor,
is shown in <a href="#FigXV9">Fig. 9</a>. The induction-motor is
really a sort of transformer, the primary winding of which
is the fixed part, or field, and the secondary winding the
rotating armature. It does not keep in step with the dynamo,
like the synchronous motor, but adapts its speed to
the “load,” or amount of work that it is called upon to do,
like a continuous-current motor.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page350">[350]</span></p>

<h4>Rotary Converters</h4>

<p>Sometimes alternating-current electric power is transformed
at the sub-station into continuous-current power.
This is done by a special kind of transformer called a “rotary
converter.” The static transformers of which we have
just been speaking are built, like ordinary reduction-coils,
with no moving parts, and operate by taking in alternating
currents at a given potential and giving out alternating
currents at a different potential, higher or lower as the case
may be. The rotary converter, however, is built something
like a dynamo, with a stationary field and a revolving armature,
and ordinarily operates by receiving an alternating
current at a given potential and delivering a continuous
current of the same or a different potential. This kind of
transformation is employed wherever it is desired to obtain
any large amount of continuous current from an alternating-current<span class="pagenum" id="Page351">[351]</span>
transmission-line; and especially to obtain
“500-volt continuous current” for operating street and interurban
electric railways, as we shall see under the <a href="#Ref007">next
heading</a>. <a href="#FigXV10">Fig. 10</a> shows one form of rotary converter built
for supplying continuous current for trolley service.</p>

<div class="container m40" id="FigXV10">

<div class="figcenter nomargin">
<img src="images/illo351.jpg" alt="Converter" />
</div>

<p class="caption"><b><i><span class="sstype">Fig. 10</span></i></b></p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Oftentimes the sub-station of a transmission system contains
both static transformers and rotary converters, to
supply both alternating current and continuous current
from the same high-voltage alternating-current line. When
the continuous current has to be transformed from one
voltage to another, a “motor dynamo” is used, consisting<span class="pagenum" id="Page352">[352]</span>
of an electric motor driving a dynamo on a common
shaft.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features of electric-power
transmission is the care that is taken to avoid the terrible
danger from the high potentials, and at the same time prevent
loss of power on the way. The electricity in the machinery
and in the line-wires that extend across the country
is veritable lightning, and has to be carefully guarded
from doing any damage or escaping. To prevent leakage,
the insulation of all of the station machinery and apparatus
is made extra good, with “high dielectric strength,” so
that it will not be punctured by the high voltage; and the
line-insulators are made very large, and electrically and
mechanically strong&mdash;quite unlike the ordinary-sized glass
or porcelain insulators that are employed for telegraph and
telephone lines. Each insulator before being put up is
tested under a “breakdown voltage” much higher than it is
to stand in actual service.</p>

<h4>Oil-switches</h4>

<p>The switching of high-voltage electric power is a knotty
problem. The circuit cannot be interrupted by “air-break”
switches, such as are used in ordinary electric-light stations,
for any attempt to do so would result in a destructive
arc many feet long, that could not be extinguished.
Therefore “oil-switches” are always used to control the
line-circuits at the main generating station and the sub-stations.
In these oil-switches&mdash;which are designed to be
operated from a distance, by hand-levers, or sometimes
by electric motors&mdash;the circuit is made and broken under<span class="pagenum" id="Page353">[353]</span>
the surface of oil, which prevents the formation of an arc.
Moreover, the switchboard attendant does not have to come
anywhere near the deadly high-voltage wires, but can make
the necessary connections at a safe distance.</p>

<h4 id="Ref007">Electric Traction</h4>

<p>The use of the electric motor to propel vehicles of all
kinds is called electric traction. It is, of course, a branch
of electric power, which we have just been considering; and
it is in many respects the most important branch. The
wealth of a country is largely built up and maintained by
its facilities for transportation, such as its canals, highways,
railroads, and street and interurban car-lines.</p>

<p>In this field electric power is playing a most important
part, although it was not many years ago that the first
experimental electric cars were put in to replace horses on
the street-railways of our cities. The change was found to
be so successful that the field of the trolley-car was widened
and extended very rapidly, until now we have our great
suburban and interurban electric railways, with cars almost
or quite as big as those on the steam-railroads and running
at even higher speeds. During the last few years, also, the
sphere of the steam-railroad itself has been invaded by
electricity, by the construction of powerful electric locomotives
to draw passenger and freight trains.</p>

<h4>The Trolley-car</h4>

<p>Let us consider just what it is that makes a trolley-car go.
Since electric power is only mechanical energy in another<span class="pagenum" id="Page354">[354]</span>
form, we know that the motionless copper trolley-wire, suspended
over the track in our streets, is the means of propelling
the car just as truly&mdash;though in a different way&mdash;as
if it were a moving steel cable to which the car was
attached. We must keep in mind the fact that the electricity
is not itself the source of power, but only the medium
of transmission. The engine in the power-house, by turning
a dynamo there, maintains a constant electric pressure, or
“constant potential,” as it is termed, in the trolley-wire.
This pressure of electricity forces the power through the
motors of the car as soon as the motorman makes the
connection to them by turning the handle of his “controller.”</p>

<h4>The Continuous-current Motor</h4>

<p><a href="#FigXV11">Fig. 11</a> is a view of one form of continuous-current motor.
There is not much of the motor itself to be seen, because it
is entirely enclosed in a cast-iron case. The shaft of the
motor has a small “spur gear” fixed on one end, driving a
gear-wheel which is fixed on the car axle. By this arrangement
more than one revolution of the motor armature is<span class="pagenum" id="Page356">[356]</span>
required to make one revolution of the car-wheel, which
multiplies the force exerted in turning the wheel.</p>

<h4>The Controller</h4>

<p><a href="#FigXV12">Fig. 12</a> is a view of a type of controller that is used on the
platform of trolley-cars. The cover is removed to show the
contacts, inside, by which the electric power is turned on
gradually by the controller handle. The trains of electric
cars that run on the elevated structures and in the subways
of our large cities are supplied with power from a “third
rail” placed by the side of the track, on insulating supports,
and the motors on all the cars are controlled from a single
“master-controller” on the front platform of the forward
car. This system of control, known as the “multiple-unit”
system, gives electric trains several advantages over the
old kind, drawn by steam-locomotives; such as they used
to have on the New York elevated roads, for example. For
one thing, the train can be started much more quickly,
since all the motors begin to turn the car-wheels at the same
instant. Then again, the system enables a long train of cars
to be controlled as easily as a single car, and better “traction”
between wheels and track is obtained.</p>

<h4>Electric Locomotives</h4>

<p>Several of the great steam-railroads are now adopting the
electric locomotive to draw their trains. <a href="#FigXV13">Fig. 13</a> is a view
of one of the great continuous current electric locomotives
that are used by the New York Central Railroad to handle
many of its passenger-trains in and out of the Grand Central<span class="pagenum" id="Page357">[357]</span>
Station, in New York city. The motors of this powerful
electric engine, unlike those of trolley-cars, are “gearless”;
that is, their armatures are fixed directly on the locomotive
axles so that they revolve at the same speed as the driving-wheels.</p>

<p>All of the railway motors considered thus far have been
of the continuous-current type, although the current to
operate them is often obtained from alternating current
transmission-systems, through rotary converters, as described
above. The alternating current is also beginning to
be employed to drive cars and trains. One type of alternating
current railway motor, designed for “single-phase”
operation, is in use on several interurban systems in
this country, running on high-voltage alternating current
most of the time, but on continuous current when within
the city limits.</p>

<h4>Other Forms of Electric Traction</h4>

<p>Electric traction also includes electric automobiles, supplied
by storage-batteries; a slow-speed electric locomotive
for drawing canal-boats, and called “the electric mule”;
and an ingenious gasolene-electric outfit for driving cars by
electric motors without any trolley, third rail, or storage-battery.
The last-mentioned arrangement consists of a set
of electric car-motors mounted on the trucks in the usual
way, but supplied with current by a dynamo mounted on the
car itself and driven by a gasolene-engine. Thus the car
carries its own power-station about with it, and is independent
of any outside source of electricity.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">The old alchemists sought to transmute <i>matter</i> from one
form to another; and especially lead and other “base metals”
into gold, in order that they might grow rich by concentrating
the precious metal in their own selfish hands. The
modern miracle that electricity works for us, the transmutation
of <i>energy</i>, is a higher and broader thing, because it
multiplies and distributes the world’s good things.</p>

<h2 class="appendix">APPENDIX<br />
<span class="title">A DICTIONARY OF ELECTRICAL TERMS AND PHRASES</span></h2>

<p>Everybody is interested in electricity, but the ordinary reader, and
particularly the boy who attempts to use this manual intelligently, will
come across many technical words and terms that require explanation.
It would be impossible to incorporate all needful definitions in the text
proper, and the reader is therefore referred to the technical dictionary on
the succeeding pages.</p>

<p>Care has been taken in its compilation to make the definitions complete,
simple, and concise. Some of the more advanced technical terms
have been purposely omitted as not necessary in a book dealing with
elementary principles. The student in the higher branches of the science
will consult, of course, the more advanced text-books. But for our practical
purposes this elementary dictionary should answer every requirement.
To read it over is an education in itself, and the young experimenter
in electrical science should always refer to it when he comes
across a word or phrase that he does not fully understand.</p>

then allowing it to cool gradually.</p>

<p><b>Annunciator.</b> An apparatus for
giving a call from one place to another,
as from a living-room to a
hotel office, or for designating a
window or door that may have been
opened when protected by a burglar-alarm.</p>

<p><b>Annunciator-drop.</b> The little
shutter which is dropped by some
forms of annunciators, and whose
fall discloses a number or letter,
designating the location from which
the call was sent.</p>

<p><b>Anode.</b> The positive terminal in
a broken, metallic, or true conducting
circuit.</p>

<p>The terminal connected to the carbon-plate
of a battery, or to its
equivalent in any other form of electric
generator, such as a dynamo or
a voltaic pile.</p>

<p>The copper, nickel, gold, or silver

that are attached to the
shackle.</p>

<p><b>Arc.</b> A term applied to an electric
current flowing from carbon to
carbon, or from metals separated by
a short gap, as in the arc street-lamps.</p>

<p>The original arc was produced by
two vertical rods, through which the
current passed up and down. When
not in action the upper ends touched,
but as the current flowed the ends
were separated, so that the current,
passing up one carbon across the
gap and down the other, formed the
segment of a circle in jumping from
one tip to the other.</p>

<p>An arc of electric flame is of brilliant
and dazzling whiteness. The
voltaic arc is the source of the most
intense heat and light yet produced
by man. The light is due principally
to the incandescence of the ends
of carbon-pencils, when a current of
sufficient strength is passing through
them and jumping over the gap.
Undoubtedly the transferred carbon
particles have much to do with its
formation. The conductivity of the
intervening air and the intense heating
to which it is subjected, together
with its coefficient of resistance, are
other factors in the brilliant light
produced.</p>

<p><b>Arc-lamp.</b> An electric lamp
which derives its light from the
voltaic arc, by means of carbon-pencils
and a current jumping from
one to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page362">[362]</span></p>

<p><b>Arc, Quiet.</b> An arc free from the
hissing sound so common in arc-lights.</p>

<p><b>Arc, Simple.</b> A voltaic arc produced
between only two electrodes.</p>

<p><b>Armature.</b> A body of iron or other
material susceptible to magnetization,
and which is placed on or near
the poles of a magnet.</p>

<p>That part of an electric mechanism
which by magnetism is drawn
to or repelled from a magnet.</p>

<p>The core of a dynamo or motor
which revolves within the field
magnets, and which is the active
principle in the generation of current
by mechanical means, or in
the distribution of power through
electrical influence. Armatures are
sometimes made of steel, and are
permanent magnets. These are used
in magneto-generators, telegraph instruments,
and other apparatus.</p>

<p><b>Armature-bar.</b> An armature in a
dynamo or motor whose winding is
made up of conductors in the form
of bars.</p>

<p><b>Astatic Needle.</b> A combination
of two magnetic needles so adjusted
as to have as slight directive tendency
as possible. The combination is
generally made up of two needles
arranged one above the other with
the poles in opposite directions&mdash;commonly
called “Nobili’s Pair.”
These needles require but a slight
electro-force to turn them one way
or the other, and are used in astatic
galvanometers.</p>

<a href="#Ref012">Electricity, Atmospheric</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Atom.</b> The ultimate particle or
division of an elementary substance.
Electricity is largely responsible for
the presence of atoms in the atmosphere.</p>

<p><b>Atomic Attraction.</b> The attraction
of atoms for each other. Principally
due to electric disturbance.</p>

<p><b>Attraction.</b> The tendency to approach

is shown in all forms of matter. It
includes gravitation, cohesion, adhesion,
chemical affinity, electro-magnetic
and dynamic attraction.</p>

<p><b>Aurora.</b> A luminous electric display
seen in the northern heavens.
It is commonly thought to be the
electric discharges of the earth into
the atmosphere, due to revolution of
the former and to the heat produced
at the equator. As compared to
the static machine for generating
frictional electricity, the earth represents
the revolving wheel gathering
the current and discharging it
at the poles.</p>

<p><b>Automatic Cut-out.</b> An electro-magnetic
switch introduced into a
circuit, so as to break the circuit of
the latter should it become overloaded
with current; it also acts in
the event of a mechanical interruption.</p>

<p><b>Automatic Regulation.</b> A speed
regulator worked by electricity so
that a uniform flow of current may
be secured automatically.</p>

<p id="Ref023"><b>Ayrton’s Condenser.</b> This is a
pile of glass plates separated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page363">[363]</span>
small pieces of glass at the four
comers, so that the plates cannot
touch each other. Tin-foil is pasted
on both sides of every plate, and
the two coatings are connected.
The tin-foil on each second plate is
smaller in area than that on the
others, and the plates are connected
in two sets, negative and positive.
In this construction it will be seen
that the glass is not the dielectric
proper, but acts only as the plane
to which the tin-foil is pasted.
One set of plates are connected to
a binding-post by strips of tin-foil,
and the other set are connected to
another binding-post in a similar
manner.</p>

<p id="Ref038"><b>Battery Cell, Elements of.</b> The
plates of zinc and carbon, or of zinc<span class="pagenum" id="Page364">[364]</span>
and copper, in a cell are called elements.
The plate unattacked by the
solution, such as the carbon or copper,
is the negative element, while
the one attacked and corroded by
the electrolyte is the positive.</p>

<p id="Ref028"><b>Battery, Dry.</b> A form of open
circuit cell in which the electrolyte

contact between cup and carbon at
the bottom of the cell. The gelatinous
chemical mass is then packed
in closely about the carbon, so as to
nearly fill the cup. A capping of asphaltum,
wax, or other non-conducting
and sealing material is placed
over the electrolyte, and this hardens
about the carbon and around the top
inner edge of the zinc cup. The latter
becomes the positive pole, the
carbon the negative. Binding-posts,
or connections, may be attached to
the zinc and carbon to facilitate connections.</p>

<p><b>Battery, Galvanic.</b> The old name
for a voltaic battery.</p>

<p id="Ref045"><b>Battery, Gravity.</b> A battery in
which the separation of fluids is obtained
through their difference in
specific gravity&mdash;for example, the
bluestone cell. The sulphate of copper
solution, being the more dense,
goes to the bottom, while the zinc
solution stays at the top. In its action
the acid at the top corrodes
the zinc, while at the bottom the solution
is decomposed and deposits
metallic copper on the thin copper
plates.</p>

<p id="Ref060"><b>Battery, Leclanché.</b> An open circuit
battery consisting of a jar, a
porous cup, and the carbon and
zinc elements, the electrolyte of
which is a solution of ammonium
chloride (sal-ammoniac). The carbon
plate is placed in the porous cup,
and packed in with a mixture of
powdered manganese binoxide and
graphite, to serve as a depolarizer.
A half-saturated solution of sal-ammoniac
is placed in the outer jar,
and a rod of zinc suspended in it.
Another form of the battery is to
omit the porous cup and use twice
the bulk of carbon, both elements
being suspended in the one solution
of sal-ammoniac; this form of battery
is used for open-circuit work
only, such as bells, buzzers, and annunciators.
It is not adapted for
lights, power, or plating purposes.</p>

<p><b>Battery Mud.</b> A deposit of mud-like
character which forms at the
bottom of gravity batteries, and
which consists of metallic copper
precipitated by the zinc. It only
occurs where wasteful action has
taken place.</p>

used in speaking of a number of
dynamos coupled to supply the
same circuit. They may be coupled
in series or parallel.</p>

<p id="Ref078"><b>Battery, Plunge.</b> A battery in a
cabinet or frame, so arranged that
the active plates can be removed
or raised out of the solutions. This
is usually accomplished by having
the plates attached to a movable
frame which, by means of a ratchet-shaft
and chains, can be raised or
lowered. Its object is to prevent
the corrosion of the plates when not
in use.</p>

<p id="Ref081"><b>Battery, Primary.</b> A voltaic cell
or battery generating electric energy
by direct consumption of material.
The ordinary voltaic cell, or galvanic

rays of ordinary light. These
rays are used chiefly in connection
with the photographic dry-plate.</p>

<p><b>Bell, Electric.</b> A bell rung by

<p><b>Bichromate of Potash.</b> A strong,
yellowish-red chemical, used chiefly
in battery fluids and electrolytes.</p>

<p><b>Bifilar Winding.</b> The method
followed in winding resistance-coils.
To prevent them from creating fields
of force, the wire is doubled and the
looped end started in the coil.
Since the current passes in opposite
senses in the two lays of the winding,
no field of force is produced.</p>

<p><b>Binding.</b> Unattached wire wound
round armature-coils to hold them

<h3>C</h3>

<p><b>C.</b> An abbreviation for centigrade
when speaking of thermal
temperature. In chemistry the
centigrade scale is used extensively,
but in air temperatures the Fahrenheit
scale is universally employed.</p>

<p><b>Cable, Aerial.</b> A cable that contains
a number of wires separately
insulated, the entire mass being protected
by an external insulation.
It is suspended in the air from pole
to pole, and sometimes its weight
is so great that a supporting wire is
carried along with it (usually overhead),
the large cable being suspended
from it by cable-hangers.</p>

<p><b>Cable Box</b>. A box to receive cable
ends and protect them; also, the box
in which cable ends and line-wires are
joined. Submarine cable boxes are
usually near the ground, while telephone
and telegraph cable boxes are
mounted on poles, the cables running
from the ground and up the
poles to the boxes.</p>

<p><b>Cable-core.</b> The conductors of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page367">[367]</span>
cable which make up its interior
mass. For the convenience of linemen
the wires are often insulated
with different-colored materials so

pressing a button, and which is
operated by electricity.</p>

<p><b>Calling-drop.</b> A drop-shutter
which is worked by electricity in a
telegraph or telephone exchange; it
denotes the location from which the
call was sent in. Small red incandescent
lamps have taken the place
of the drops in most of the large telephone
exchanges, for they are noiseless
and do not annoy the operators
as the drops and buzzers did.</p>

<p><b>Candle-power.</b> The amount of
light given by the standard candle.
The legal English and American
standard is a sperm candle burning
two grains a minute.</p>

<p id="Ref100"><b>Candle, Standard.</b> The standard

which consumes two grains of sperm
wax per minute, and produces a light
of a brightness equal to one candle-power.</p>

<p id="Ref053"><b>Caoutchouc.</b> India-rubber. So
named because originally its chief
use was to erase or rub off pencil
marks. It is a substance existing,
in a thick fluid state, in the sap or
juices of certain tropical trees and
vines; it possesses a very high value
as an insulator for wire and circuits.
The unworked, crude rubber is called
virgin gum, but after it is kneaded
it is called masticated or pure gum
rubber.</p>

<p><b>Capacity.</b> A term used when
speaking of the carrying power of a
wire or circuit. The capacity of a
wire, rod, bar, or other conductor
is sufficient so long as the current
does not heat it. Directly electric
heat is generated, we speak of the
conductor as being overloaded or
having its capacity overtaxed.</p>

<p><b>Capacity of a Telegraph Conductor.</b>
The electric capacity may
be identical in quality with that of
any other conductor. In quantity
it varies not only in different wires,
but for the same wire under different
conditions. A wire reacting through
the surrounding air, or other dielectric,
upon the earth represents
one element of a condenser, the
earth in general representing the
other. A wire placed near the
earth has greater capacity than one
strung upon high poles, although
the wires may be of identical length
and size and of the same metal.
The effect of high capacity is to retard
the transmission of current,
the low capacity facilitates transmission.</p>

<p><b>Capacity, Storage.</b> In secondary
batteries, the quantity of electric
current they can supply, when fully
charged, without exhaustion. This
capacity is measured or reckoned in
ampere-hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page368">[368]</span></p>

<p><b>Carbon.</b> One of the elements in
graphitic form used as an electric-current
conductor. It is the only
substance which conducts electricity,
and which cannot be melted with
comparative ease by increase of
current. It exists in three modifications&mdash;charcoal,
graphite, and the
diamond. In its graphitic form it
is used as an electro-current conductor,
as in batteries and arc-light
electrodes, and as filaments in incandescent
lamps. In arc-lamp use
the carbons are usually electro-plated
on the outside with a film of
copper which acts as a better conductor.</p>

<p><b>Carbon, Artificial.</b> Carbon-dust,
powdered coke, or gas carbon is
mixed with molasses, coal-tar, syrup,
or some similar carbonaceous fluid,
so that the mass is plastic. It can
then be moulded or pressed into
shapes, and heated to full redness for
several hours by artificial or electric
heat. For lamp-carbons the mixture
is forced through a round die
by heavy pressure, and is cut into
suitable lengths, then fired or baked.</p>

<p>After removing and cooling, the
carbons are sometimes dipped again
into the fluid used for cementing the
original mass and re-ignited. This
process is termed “nourishing.” All
carbon is a resisting medium, but at
high temperature the resistance is
only about one-third as great; that
is, the current will pass through a
red-hot carbon three times better
than through the cold carbon; or a
current of thirty amperes will be conducted
as easily through a hot carbon
as ten amperes through a cold one.</p>

<p><b>Carbon-cored.</b> A carbon for arc-lamps,
the core being of softer carbon
than the outer surface. It is
supposed to give a steadier light,
and fixes the position of the arc.</p>

<p><b>Carbon-dioxide.</b> A compound gas,
or carbonic-acid gas. It is a dielectric.</p>

<p><b>Carbon-holders.</b> In arc-lamps,
the clamps arranged to hold the carbon-pencils.</p>

<p><b>Carbonization.</b> The ignition of
an organic substance in a closed vessel,
so as to expel all constituents
from it except the carbon.</p>

<p>A destructive distillation.</p>

<p><b>Carbon Resistance.</b> (<i>See</i> <a href="#Ref014">Resistance,
Carbon</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Carbon Volatilization.</b> In arc-lamps
the heat is so intense that it
is believed a part of the carbon-pencil
is volatilized, as vapor, before
being burned or oxidized by the
oxygen of the air.</p>

<p><b>Carbons, Bare</b>. (<i>See</i> <a href="#Ref015">Bare Carbons</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Carrying Capacity.</b> In a current-conductor,
its carrying capacity up
to the heating-point. It is expressed
in amperes.</p>

<p><b>Cascade.</b> The arrangement of a
series of Leyden-jars in properly
insulated stools, or supports, for
accumulating frictional electricity.
They are arranged in a manner somewhat
similar to a battery of galvanic
cells, the inner coating of one being
connected to the outer coating of
the next, and so on through the
series.</p>

<p><b>Case-hardening, Electric.</b> A process
by which the surface of iron is
converted into steel by applying a
proper carbonaceous material to it
while it is being heated by an electric
current.</p>

<p><b>Cautery, Electric.</b> An electro-surgical
appliance for removing diseased
parts or arresting hemorrhages.
It takes the place of the
knife or other cutting instrument.
It is a loop of platinum wire heated
to whiteness by an electric current.</p>

<p><b>C.C.</b> An abbreviation commonly

the electrolyte used for electro-plating.</p>

<p><b>Cell, Regenerated.</b> A cell restored

of recharging.</p>

<p><b>Cell, Standard.</b> Meaning the same
as battery. The vessel, including
its contents, in which electricity is
generated.</p>

<p><b>Cell, Storage.</b> Two plates of
metal, or compounds of metal, whose
chemical relations are changed by
the passage of an electric current
from one plate to the other through
an electrolyte in which they are immersed.</p>

<p><b>Cements, Electrical.</b> Cements of
a non-conducting nature, such as
marine glue and sticky compounds,
used in electrical work.</p>

<p><b>Centrifugal Force.</b> A diametric
revolving force which throws a
body away from its axis of rotation.
A merry-go-round is a simple example
of this force. The more
rapidly the platform revolves the
greater the tendency for those on
it to be thrown off and out from the
centre. The high velocity attained
by the armatures in motors and
dynamos would throw the wires out
of place and cause them to rub
against the surfaces of the field-magnets.
Consequently, wire bands
or binders are necessary to keep the
coils of wire from spreading under
the influence of the centrifugal force.</p>

<p><b>Charge.</b> The quantity of electricity
that is present on the surface
of a body or conductor.</p>

<p>The component chemical parts
that are employed to excite the elements
of a cell in generating electric
current.</p>

<p id="Ref085"><b>Charge, Residual.</b> After a Leyden-jar,
or other condenser, has been
discharged by the ordinary methods,
a second discharge (of less
amount) can be had after a few
minutes’ waiting. This is due to
what is known as the residual
charge, and is connected in some
way with the molecular distortion
of the dielectric.</p>

<p><b>Chemical Change.</b> When bodies
unite so as to satisfy affinity, or to
bring about the freeing of thermal or
other energy, the union is usually
accompanied by sensible heat or
light. Sulphuric acid added to water
produces heat; a match in burning
produces light. Another form
of chemical change is decomposition
or separation (the reverse of combination),
such as takes place in the
voltaic-battery, the electro-plating
bath, and other forms of electrolysis.
This is not accompanied by heat
or light, but by the evolution of electricity.</p>

<p><b>Chemical Element.</b> (<i>See</i> <a href="#Ref016">Element,
Chemical</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Chemistry.</b> The science which
treats of the atomic and molecular
relations of the elements and their
chemical compounds. Chemistry is
divided into many departments, but
electro-chemistry treats only of the
science wherein electricity plays an
active part, such as batteries, electro-plating,
and electro-metallurgy.</p>

<p><b>Choking-coil.</b> (<b>See</b> <a href="#Ref017">Coil, Choking</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Circle, Magic.</b> A form of electro-magnet.
It is a thick circle of
round iron used in connection with
a magnetized coil to illustrate electro-magnetic
attraction.</p>

<p><b>Circuit.</b> A conducting-path for
electric currents. Properly speaking,
a complete circuit has the ends
joined, and includes a source of current,
an apparatus, and other elements
introduced in the path. When
the circuit is complete it is called
active. The term circuit is also
applied to portions of a true circuit&mdash;as,
an internal or external circuit.</p>

<p id="Ref010"><b>Circuit, Astatic.</b> A circuit so
wound, with reference to the direction
of the currents passing through<span class="pagenum" id="Page370">[370]</span>
it, that the terrestrial or other lines
of force have no directive effect
upon it.</p>

<p id="Ref025"><b>Circuit-breaker.</b> Any apparatus
for opening and closing a circuit,
such as switches, automatic cut-outs,
lightning-arresters, and the like.</p>

<p>A ratchet-wheel engaged with a
spring, or wire, which rests against
the teeth. The current passes
through the wire, the wheel, and
axle. The wheel is revolved by a
crank, and as the ratchets pass the
spring, or wire, an instantaneous
make-and-break occurs. The speed
of the wheel regulates the frequency
of the interruptions.</p>

<p id="Ref039"><b>Circuit, External.</b> A portion of
the circuit not included within the
generator, such as a secondary telegraph
key and sounder.</p>

<p id="Ref046"><b>Circuit, Grounded.</b> A circuit in
which the ground is used as a conductor.
This is common in telegraph
and telephone lines, particularly
for short distances where the
conductivity of the earth does not
offer too much resistance.</p>

<p id="Ref050"><b>Circuit, Incandescent.</b> A circuit
in which incandescent lamps are installed.</p>

<p><b>Circuit Indicator.</b> A pocket-compass,
galvanometer, or other device
for indicating or detecting the condition
of a wire, whether it is active
or dead, and, if active, in which direction
the current is flowing. It
may also give a general idea of its
strength.</p>

<p id="Ref056"><b>Circuit, Internal.</b> That portion
of an electric circuit which is included
within the generator.</p>

<p><b>Circuit Loop.</b> A minor circuit introduced,
in series, into another circuit
by a switch or cut-out, so that it
becomes a part of the main circuit.</p>

<p id="Ref066"><b>Circuit, Main.</b> a circuit or main
line, includes the apparatus supplying
current to it. Thus distinguished
from a local circuit.</p>

<p id="Ref068"><b>Circuit, Metallic.</b> A circuit in
which the current outside the generator
passes through metal parts
or wire, but not through the ground.
Electric light and power lines are
always metallic circuits. An electro-plating
apparatus may be properly
termed a metallic circuit, although
a part of the circuit is formed
by the electrolyte in the bath. The
essential meaning of the words metallic
circuit is that the earth does not
form a part of the return circuit.</p>

<p id="Ref073"><b>Circuit, Open.</b> A circuit in which
a switch has been opened to prevent
the continuous flow of current,
such as an electric-bell circuit, which
normally remains open, and which
is active only when the push-button
is pressed, thereby closing the circuit
and operating the bell. An open-circuit
battery is one that remains
inactive when the circuit is open.</p>

<p><b>Circuit, Parallel.</b> A term signifying
a multiple circuit.</p>

<p id="Ref083"><b>Circuit, Quadruple.</b> A single circuit
capable of having four messages
transmitted over it simultaneously&mdash;two
in one direction, and two in the
other.</p>

<p id="Ref089"><b>Circuit, Return.</b> In telegraphy
the ground is used as the return circuit.
It is also that portion of a
circuit which leads from an apparatus
back to the terminal of a dynamo
or battery, usually the negative
wire.</p>

<p id="Ref094"><b>Circuit, Short.</b> A connection between
two parts of a circuit, causing
the current to skip a great part of
its appointed path. Short-circuits
prevent the proper working of any
electrical apparatus.</p>

<p id="Ref095"><b>Circuit, Simple.</b> A circuit containing
a single generator, the proper
wire for carrying the current, and
a switch to operate it. An electric-bell
line, a single telegraph line, or
a direct telephone line are all simple
circuits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page371">[371]</span></p>

<p><b>Clamp.</b> A tool for grasping and
holding the ends of wires while joining
them.</p>

<p>The appliance for holding the carbon-pencils
in arc-lamps.</p>

<p><b>Cleats.</b> Blocks of wood, porcelain,
or other insulating material
used to hold wires against a wall or
beam. They have one, two, and
three notches at one side, for single,
double, and three wire systems.</p>

<p><b>Clutch, Electric.</b> A form of magnetic
brake applied to car-wheels,
the armatures of motors, and other
revolving mechanism, whereby the
current, passing through a coil,
magnetizes a mass of cast-iron, and
brings it to bear frictionally upon
the moving parts of the mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Code, Cipher.</b> A set of disconnected
words which, in accordance
with a prearranged key, stand for
whole sentences and phrases. Commercially
the system is used as a
short-cut&mdash;ten words perhaps meaning
what otherwise it would take
forty or fifty words to express. It is
used extensively in telegraphy, both
as an abbreviated message and as a
means for securing secrecy.</p>

<p><b>Coherer.</b> Conducting particles
constituting a semi-conducting
bridge between two electrodes, and
serving to detect electro-magnetic
waves. The coherer in wireless
telegraphy is understood to mean
that form of radio-receiver which,
being normally at high resistance, is,
under the influence of Hertzian-waves,
changed to a low resistance,
thus becoming relatively a conductor.
Tubes of various kinds
have been used for this purpose.
Within them is a filling of carbon
granules, copper filings, nickel and
silver filings, and other substances.
Marconi’s coherer consists of a tube
one and one-half inches long and
one-twelfth inch internal diameter.
This is filled with filings&mdash;90 per
cent. of nickel, 10 per cent. of silver.
A globule of mercury coats the outer
surface of each grain with a thin
film of the quicksilver. Into both
ends a piece of pure silver wire is
plugged. These latter are a quarter
of an inch long, and fit the tube
very accurately. The tube is thus
sealed, and it is considered preferable
to have a slight vacuum within
it.</p>

<p><b>Coil.</b> A strand of wire wound in
circular form about a spool, a soft-iron
core, or in layers, as a coil of
rope.</p>

<p>An electro-magnetic generator.</p>

<p>A helix. (<i>See also</i> <a href="#Ref012a">Induction</a>, <a href="#Ref019">Resistance</a>,
<a href="#Ref020">Magnetizing</a>.)</p>

<p id="Ref017"><b>Coil, Choking.</b> A form of resistance
to regulate the flow of current.
Any coil of insulated wire wound
upon a laminated or divided iron
core forms a choking-coil. In alternating-current
work special choking-coils
are used. They have a movable
iron core, and by thrusting it
in or out the power is increased or
diminished, thus raising or lowering
the lights, the same as gas is regulated.</p>

<p id="Ref041"><b>Coil, Faradic.</b> The name given
to a medical induction-coil or faradic
machine.</p>

<p id="Ref055"><b>Coil, Induction.</b> A coil in which
the electro-motive force of a portion
of a circuit is, by induction, made
to produce higher or lower electro-motive
forces in an adjacent circuit,
or in a circuit a part of which adjoins
the original circuit. There
are three principal parts to all induction-coils&mdash;the
core, the primary
coil, and the secondary coil.
The core is a mass of soft iron, cast
or wrought, but preferably divided&mdash;for
example, a bundle of rods or
bars. The primary coil of comparatively
larger wire is wound
about this core, each layer being
properly insulated and varnished, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page372">[372]</span>
coated with melted paraffine, to
bind the wires. The secondary coil
is of fine wire, and is wound about
the primary coil. A great many
turns of the fine wire are necessary,
and care must be taken to properly
insulate each layer and shellac the
wires. The primary must be well
insulated from the secondary coil,
so as to prevent sparking, which
would destroy the insulation. A
make-and-break is operated by the
primary coil, and is constructed
upon the general form of an electric
bell or buzzer movement. Extra
currents which interfere with the
action of an induction-coil are
avoided by the use of a condenser.
(<i>See also</i> <a href="#Ref021">Condenser</a>.) The induction-coil
produces a rapid succession of
sparks which may spring across a
gap of thirty or forty inches, according
to the size of the coil. Induction-coils
are used extensively in electric
work, especially in telephone transmitters,
wireless telegraphy, electric
welding, and in the alternating-current
system.</p>

<p id="Ref065"><b>Coil, Magnetizing.</b> A coil of insulated
wire so wound that a well
or aperture will be formed. Within
this well a piece of steel is placed, so
that an electric current, passing
through the wires, will magnetize the
steel; or a steel rod may be passed
in and out of the hole several times
while a strong current is travelling
through the coil, thus magnetizing
the rod.</p>

<p id="Ref086"><b>Coil, Resistance.</b> A coil so constructed
that it will offer resistance
to a steady current of too great
electro-motive force for the safety
of the apparatus. Generally the
coil is made by doubling the wire
without breaking it, then starting
at the doubled end to wind it in
coil or spring fashion. If the wire
is too heavy to wind double, a single
strand is wound on a square or triangular
insulator in which notches
are made. Then, alternately between
the coils, the second strand
is wound. The strands are joined
at one end of the coil, but those at
the other are left free for unions with
other wires. (<i>See also</i> <a href="#Ref019">Resistance</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Coil, Retarding.</b> A choking-coil.
A resistance-coil.</p>

<p><b>Coil, Ribbon.</b> Instead of wire,
flat, thin strips of sheet-metal are
sometimes used for resistance-coils,
doubled, as explained above. The
wraps are insulated with sheet-mica,
micanite, or asbestos, to prevent
short-circuiting.</p>

<p id="Ref091"><b>Coil, Ruhmkorff.</b> A common type
of induction-coil with a vibrator or
circuit-breaker. Used with constant
and direct current.</p>

<p>A step-up transformer with a circuit-breaker
attachment.</p>

<p><b>Coils, Idle.</b> Coils in a dynamo
in which no electro-motive force is
being generated or developed.</p>

for the voltaic pile. The apparatus
made up of a pile of disks of copper
and zinc, separated by pieces of flannel
wet with acidulated water.</p>

of teeth project like the teeth
of a comb. It is used as a collector
of electricity from the plate of a
frictional electric machine.</p>

<p><b>Commutator.</b> An apparatus used
on motors and dynamos and induction-coils
for changing the direction
of currents. It is made in
a variety of types, but usually in
the shape of insulated bars closely
packed about an armature shaft.</p>

<p><b>Commutator-bars.</b> The metallic
segments of a dynamo or motor-commutator.</p>

<p><b>Commutators, Quiet.</b> Commutators
that do not spark during the
revolutions of the armature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page373">[373]</span></p>

<p><b>Compass.</b> An apparatus for indicating
the directive force of the
earth upon the magnetic needle.
It consists of a case covered with
glass, in which a magnetized needle,
normally pointing to the north, is
balanced on a point at the centre.
Under the needle a card is arranged
on which the degrees or points of the
compass are inscribed. A valuable
instrument in electrical work, magnetism,
etc.</p>

<p><b>Compass, Liquid.</b> A form of
marine compass. The needle is attached
to a card or disk which floats
in alcohol or other spirits, so as to
check undue oscillation.</p>

<p><b>Compass, Mariners’.</b> A compass
in which the needle is attached to a
card that rotates in pointing to the
north. A mark, called the “lubber’s
mark,” is made upon the case,
and this is in line with the ship’s
keel, so that a glance at the card
will indicate the direction in which
the ship is headed.</p>

<p><b>Compass, Spirit.</b> A form of mariners’
compass in which the bowl,
or case, is sealed and filled with
alcohol. The compass-card works
as a spindle, and, by a series of
air compartments, floats on the alcohol.
The friction of the pivot is
thereby greatly diminished, making
the compass a very sensitive
one.</p>

<p><b>Compass, Standard.</b> A compass
employed as a standard by which
to compare other compasses.</p>

<p id="Ref021"><b>Condenser.</b> An appliance for
storing up electro-static charges; it
is also called a static accumulator.
The telegraphic condenser consists
of a box packed full of sheets of tin-foil
having a sheet of paraffined paper
or sheet-mica between every
two sheets. The alternate sheets of
tin-foil are connected together, and
each set has its binding-post. (<i>See
also</i> <a href="#Ref008">Electrostatic Accumulator</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Condenser, Air.</b> (<i>See</i> <a href="#Ref022">Air-condenser</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Condenser, Ayrton’s.</b> (<i>See</i> <a href="#Ref023">Ayrton’s
Condenser</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Condenser-plate.</b> (<i>See</i> <a href="#Ref024">Plate, Condenser</a>.)</p>

<p id="Ref098"><b>Condenser, Sliding.</b> An apparatus
in the form of a Leyden-jar
whose coatings can be slid past each
other to diminish or increase the
face area, and also to diminish or increase
the capacity of the condenser.</p>

<p><b>Conductance.</b> The conducting
power of a mass of material, varying
according to its shape and dimensions.
The cylindrical or round
conductor is the best type for the
conveyance of electric currents.</p>

<p><b>Conduction.</b> The transmission of
electricity through an immobile medium,
such as a wire, or rod, or a bar.</p>

<p><b>Conductivity.</b> Ability to conduct
electric currents. The conductivity
of a wire is its power to conduct or
transmit a current. Glass has no
conductivity, and it is therefore a
non-conductor.</p>

<p><b>Conductivity, Variable.</b> The
change in the conducting or transmitting
powers of metals and substances
under different temperatures.
Hot metal conducts an electric
current better than cold. A
hot carbon-pencil in an arc-light
conducts the current better than
when the light is first started, for
as it warms up under the influence
of the arc-flame the current passes
more freely. Five minutes after the
current is turned on the lamps in the
circuit give a steady light, and do
not sputter as when they first start
up.</p>

<p><b>Conductor.</b> Anything which permits
the passage of electric current.
The term conductor is a relative one,
and, excepting a vacuum, there is
probably no substance that has not
some conductive power. Metals,
beginning with silver, are the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page374">[374]</span>
conductors, liquids next, glass the
worst. The ether, or air, is a conductor
of sound and electric vibratory
disturbances, but not in
the same sense as the ground. The
air conducts frictional electricity,
while the ground acts as a conductor
for the galvanic current, or “current
electricity.” By this last term
is meant electricity which flows continually,
instead of discharging all
at once, with an accompanying
spark or flash.</p>

<p><b>Conductor, Overhead.</b> Overhead
electric lines, wires or cables, for
conducting current. Generally poles
are erected for this purpose.</p>

<p id="Ref082"><b>Conductor, Prime.</b> A cylindrical
or spherical body with no points or
angles, but rounded everywhere
and generally of metal. If made of
other material, such as wood, glass,
or composition, its entire surface is
rendered conductive by being covered
with sheet-metal, such as tin-foil,
gold-leaf or tinsel, applied to it
with paste, shellac, or glue. A
prime conductor should be mounted
on an insulated stand; it is employed
to collect and retain frictional electricity
generated by a static machine.</p>

<p><b>Conductor, Underground.</b> An insulated
conductor which is placed
under the surface of the earth,
passing through conduits.</p>

<p><b>Connect.</b> The act of bringing two
ends of wire together, either temporarily
or permanently. Bringing
one end of a conductor into contact
with another so as to establish an
electric connection.</p>

<p><b>Connector.</b> A sleeve, with screws
or other clamping device, into which
the ends of wires or rods may be
passed and held securely. A binding-post
and spring-jack comes under
this head.</p>

<p><b>Contact.</b> The electrical union of
two conductors, whether temporary
or permanent. It may be established
by touching the ends or terminals
of a circuit through the agency of a
push-button, a telegraph-key, an
electric switch, etc.</p>

<p><b>Contact-breaker.</b> (The same as
<a href="#Ref025">Circuit-breaker</a>, <i>which see</i>.)</p>

<p><b>Contact, Loose.</b> A contact formed
by two or several surfaces imposed
one upon another and held by
their weight alone.</p>

<p><b>Contact-point.</b> A point, or stud,
often of silver or platinum, arranged
to come into touch with a contact-spring,
such as the vibrating armature
of an electric bell.</p>

<p><b>Contact-spring.</b> A spring connected
at one end of a lead and arranged
to press against another
spring or plate, so that a plug may be
inserted between the contact-points.</p>

<p><b>Controller.</b> The lever or handle
on the switch-board of a resistance-coil,
by means of which electric current
is let in or kept out of a circuit.</p>

<p><b>Controlling Force.</b> In galvanometers
and similar instruments, the
force used to bring the needle or indicator
back to zero.</p>

<p><b>Converter.</b> An induction-coil used
with the alternating current for
changing the potential difference
and inverting the available current.
High alternating voltage may be
converted into lower direct-current
voltage, thereby increasing the amperage
or current. A converter consists
of a core of thin iron sheets,
wound with a primary coil of fine
insulated wire, with many convolutions
or turns. Also, a secondary
coil made up of coarse insulated
wire with fewer convolutions. The
coil may be jacketed with iron to
increase the permanence.</p>

<p><b>Converter, Rotary.</b> A combined
motor and dynamo whose function
is to transform a current of high or
low voltage (A-C., or D-C.) into any
other kind of current desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page375">[375]</span></p>

<p><b>Convolution.</b> The state of being
convolved; a turn, wrap, fold, or
whorl. A clock-spring is a familiar
example.</p>

<p><b>Copper-bath.</b> A solution of sulphate
of copper used in electro-plating,
electrotyping, and copper-refining
by electricity.</p>

<p><b>Cord, Flexible.</b> A flexible-wire
conductor made up of many strands
of fine wire and properly insulated
so that it may be easily twisted, bent,
or wrapped. Flexible wire is used as
the conductors for portable electric
lights, push-buttons, medical coils,
etc.</p>

<p><b>Core.</b> The iron mass (generally
located in the centre of a coil or
helix) which becomes highly magnetic
when a current is flowing
around it, but which looses its magnetism
immediately that the current
ceases to flow.</p>

<p>A conductor or the conductors of
an electric cable made up of a single
strand or many strands laid together
and twisted. These may be
of bare metal, or each one insulated
from the others.</p>

<p><b>Core-disks.</b> Disks of thin wire,
for building up armature-cores.
The usual form of a core is round or
cylindrical. A number of thin disks,
or laminations, of iron strung upon
the central shaft, and pressed firmly
together by the end-nuts or keys.
This arrangement gives a cylinder as
a base on which to wind the insulated
wire that forms a part of the
armature.</p>

<p><b>Core-disks, Pierced.</b> Core-disks
for an armature of a motor or dynamo,
which have been pierced or
bored out around the periphery.
Tubes of insulating material, such
as fibre, rubber, or paraffined paper,
are inserted in the holes and through
these the windings of wire are carried.
The coils are thus imbedded
in the solid mass of iron, and are
protected from eddy currents; also
they act to reduce the reluctance of
the air-gaps. This arrangement is
very good, from a mechanical point
of view, but in practice its use is
confined to small motors only, and
dynamos generating under one hundred
volts.</p>

<p><b>Core-disks, Toothed.</b> Core-disks
of an armature or motor where
notches are cut from the periphery.
When they are locked together, to
form the armature-core, the coils of
wire lie in the grooves formed by a
number of the disks bound together.
This construction reduces the actual
air-gaps and keeps the coils
equally spaced.</p>

<p id="Ref058"><b>Core, Laminated.</b> The core of an
armature, an induction-coil, a converter,
or any similar piece of apparatus,
which is made up of plates
or disks, insulated more or less perfectly
from one another by means of
mica or paraffined paper. The object
of laminations is to prevent the
formation of Foucault currents. A
core built up of disks is sometimes
called a radially laminated core.</p>

<p><b>Core, Ring.</b> A dynamo or motor
armature-core which forms a complete
ring.</p>

<p><b>Core, Stranded.</b> The core of a
cable, or a conducting core made up
of a number of separate wires or
strands laid or twisted together.</p>

<p><b>Core, Tubular.</b> Tubes used as
cores for electro-magnets, and also
to produce small magnetizing power.
Tubular cores are nearly as efficient
as solid ones in straight magnets,
because the principal reluctance is
due to the air-path. On increasing
the current, however, the tubular
core becomes less efficient.</p>

<p><b>Coulomb.</b> The practical unit of
electrical quantity. It is the quantity
passed by a current of one ampere
intensity in one second.</p>

<p><b>Couple.</b> The combination of two<span class="pagenum" id="Page376">[376]</span>
electrodes and a liquid, the electrodes
being immersed in the latter,
and being acted on differentially by
the liquid. This combination constitutes
a source of electro-motive
force, and, consequently of current,
and is called the galvanic or voltaic
cell or battery.</p>

<p id="Ref011"><b>Couple, Astatic.</b>. A term sometimes
applied to astatic needles when
working in pairs.</p>

<p><b>Coupling.</b> The union of cells or
generators constituting a battery;
the volume of current, or electro-motive
force, is thereby increased.</p>

<p><b>C. P.</b> An abbreviation for “candle
power”; also meaning “chemically
pure,” when speaking of chemicals.</p>

<p><b>Crater.</b> The depression that forms
in the positive carbon of a voltaic-arc.</p>

<p><b>Creeping.</b> A phenomena met with
in solution batteries. The electrolyte
creeps up the sides of the containing
jar and evaporates, leaving
a deposit of salts. Still more solution
creeps up through the salts until
it gets clear to the top and runs over.
To prevent this the tops of the jars
should be brushed with hot paraffine
for a distance of two inches from
the upper edge. The salts will not
form on paraffine. Oil is sometimes
poured on the top of the battery
solution, but this affects the elements
if it touches them, and makes
their surfaces non-conducting.</p>

<p><b>Crucible, Electric.</b> A crucible for
melting refractory substances, or for
reducing ores by means of the electric
arc produced within it. Probably
the result obtained is due more
to current incandescence than to the
action of the arc.</p>

<p><b>Crystallization, Electric.</b> Under
proper conditions many substances
and liquids take a crystalline form.
When such action is brought about
by means of electricity the term
electric crystallization may be applied
to the phenomenon. A solution
of nitrate of silver, when decomposed
by a current, will give
crystals of metallic silver. A solution
of common salt or brine, when
electrically decomposed, will produce
sodium and chlorine. The
sodium appears at the leading-out
electrode and readily unites with
carbonic-acid gas, which is injected
into the apparatus. The result of
the combination is carbonate of soda,
one of the most important products
of the alkali industry.</p>

<p id="Ref009"><b>Current, Alternating.</b> A current

<p id="Ref030"><b>Currents, Eddy.</b> Useless currents
in an armature, in the pole pieces,
and in the magnetic cores of dynamos
and motors. They are created
by the high speed of the armature
in its rotation, or by other electric
currents induced by the armature’s
motion through magnetic fields.</p>

<p id="Ref042"><b>Currents, Faradic.</b> Induced currents.
They take their name from
Michael Faraday, the original investigator
of the phenomena of
electro-magnetic induction. The
secondary or induced electro-magnetic
currents and their accompanying
phenomena.</p>

<p>A series of alternating electro-static
discharges from influence
machine, such as the Holtz and
Wimshurst.</p>

<p id="Ref044"><b>Currents, Foucault.</b> A form of
currents produced in revolving armature-cores;
sometimes called eddy
currents. They are useless.</p>

<p id="Ref048"><b>Currents, Harmonic.</b> Currents
which alternate periodically, and
vary harmonically. Currents which
vibrate at certain pitches, as, for
instance, the currents in wireless
telegraphy. Two instruments must
be tuned to the same pitch in order
to be responsive. Thus an instrument
sending out waves of 70,000
vibrations cannot be recorded by
one tuned much below or above
the same number.</p>

<p>Sound waves of sympathetic or
harmonic vibrations.</p>

no more current shall pass through
the former.</p>

<p><b>Cut-out, Automatic.</b> A safety device
for automatically cutting out
a circuit to prevent accident or
the burning-out of an apparatus,
due to an overload of current. It
is worked by an electro-magnet and
spring. An overload of current
causes a magnet of high resistance
to draw an armature towards it,
and this, in turn, releases the spring
of the cut-out device. Sometimes
a strip or wire of fusible metal is
employed which is in circuit with
a switch. The excess of current
fuses the metal, and the broken circuit
releases a spring-jack, which, in
turn, breaks the circuit.</p>

<p><b>Cut-out, Safety.</b> A block of non-conducting
material, such as marble,
slate, or porcelain, carrying a safety-fuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page378">[378]</span>

out or melts and breaks the circuit
before the apparatus is damaged.</p>

<p><b>Cut-out, Wedge.</b> A cut-out operated
by a wedge, such as a spring-jack
or the plugs at the end of the
flexible wires on the switch-boards

which the wire in a galvanometer is
sometimes coiled. It acts to check
the needle oscillations.</p>

<p>A brass or copper sheathing or
tube placed between the primary
and secondary coils of an induction-coil
to cut off induction and diminish
the current and potential of the
secondary circuit. When the tube
is drawn out gradually the induction
increases. It is commonly
used in medical coils to adjust their
strength of action.</p>

<p><b>D-C.</b> An abbreviation for direct

convolutions or turns of wire on
an armature which are considered
to be dead. There are supposed to
be about eighty per cent. of the
turns on an armature that are active

balance are outside the magnetic
field and are termed dead, although
they are necessary to the production
of electro-motive force.</p>

force is essential, and the alternating
current is most fatal.</p>

chemicals into a new compound or
substance.</p>

<p><b>Deflection.</b> In magnetism, the

of a liquid by the employment
of electricity, which, by electrifying
the liquid, assists the effects of heat.
It is asserted that the process is

<p><b>Efficiency.</b> The relation of work
done to the electrical energy absorbed.
The efficiency is not equal
to the energy absorbed, because it
always takes more power to generate
a current than is given back in

an energy which fills the universe
and which is the active principle
in heat, light, magnetism, chemical
affinity, and mechanical motion.</p>

<p><b>Induction-coil.</b> (<i>See</i> <a href="#Ref055">Coil, Induction</a>.)</p>

<p id="Ref036"><b>Induction, Electro-magnetic.</b>
When negative and positive currents
are brought towards each other
against their material repulsive
tendencies the result is work, or
energy, and the consequent energy
increases the intensity of both currents
temporarily. The variations
thus temporarily produced in the
currents are examples of electro-magnetic
induction. A current is
surrounded by lines of force. The
approach of two circuits&mdash;one negative,
the other positive&mdash;involves a
change in the lines of force about
the secondary circuit. Lines of
force and current are so intimately
connected that a change in one
compels a change in the other.
Therefore, the induced current in
the secondary may be attributed to
the change in the field of force in

or positive, which attracts the S pole
of the needle.</p>

<p id="Ref040"><b>Magnetic Poles, False.</b> It has

copper, or other metals, the iron
adhering to the magnet, while the

<p><b>Magnetism.</b> The phenomena of attraction
exerted by one body for
another. It has been commonly
understood that magnetism and
electricity are very closely related,<span class="pagenum" id="Page392">[392]</span>
for without electricity magnetism
could not exist, although it has not
been shown clearly that magnetism
plays any part in the generation of
electricity. Magnetism is the phenomenal
force exerted by one body
having two poles (negative and positive)
for like bodies. The horseshoe
magnet or a bar of magnetized
steel are the simplest examples of
this. If both ends of the horseshoe
were positive they would not attract,
but would repel. If both
ends of a bar were positive they
would repel; but as one is negative,
or north-seeking, and the other positive,
they exert lines of force which
attract like bodies, such as bits of
iron, nails, and needles. No energy
is required to maintain magnetism
in a tempered steel object, such as
the wiring about a soft iron core
when it has been magnetized, but
electric current must flow about the
soft iron core in order to render it
a magnet. So soon as the current
ceases to flow the magnetism ceases
and the soft iron fails to attract.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
